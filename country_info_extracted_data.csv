Afghanistan,"The security situation is extremely unstable and the threat to U.S. citizens remains critical. No province in Afghanistan should be considered immune from violence, and the potential exists throughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, against U.S. and other foreign nationals at any time. U.S. citizens who do decide to go to Afghanistan should maintain a low profile and exercise extreme discretion in disclosing their movement plans and personal information. Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Decades of disorder and warfare have made Afghanistan fertile territory for international terrorism. U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals are primary targets of terrorist organizations. Violent extremist groups across Afghanistan continue to utilize a variety of tactics to expand their territorial influence, disrupt governance, and create a public perception of instability. Such tactics include the use of attackers laden with suicide vests, vehicle-borne explosive devices, magnetic explosive devices, indirect fire (rockets and mortars), and direct fire (shootings and rocket propelled grenades). Local security forces, buildings housing ministries and other public sector institutions, foreign embassies, non-government organization offices, and soft targets, such as hotels, markets, schools, hospitals, and public gatherings, are common attack targets. Kabul has been and remains a high-profile location for large-scale terror attacks, as successful operations in the capital tend to generate media coverage. U.S. citizens in Afghanistan should familiarize themselves with their residential compound or hotel’s emergency planning and rehearse the steps they would take if the venue were to come under attack. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Kidnapping/Hostage Taking/Wrongful Detention : Violent extremist groups and kidnapping syndicates are actively targeting foreign nationals, specifically U.S. citizens, in Afghanistan, including journalists, aid workers, teachers, medical professionals, and individuals associated with international and non-governmental organizations. Criminal groups in Afghanistan will target any individual perceived to have money for kidnapping and/or extortion. Kidnap-for-ransom syndicates may also sell their captives to terrorist groups, with victims potentially spending years in captivity. Additionally, the threat of wrongful detention remains high as U.S. citizens have been detained and held for indefinite periods in Afghanistan under unclear or unjust circumstances. Demonstrations and Riots : U.S. citizens should avoid all rallies and demonstrations, as even events intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence with little warning. Public gatherings and demonstrations have also been the targets of terrorist attacks. Property/Business Disputes: Afghan-Americans returning to Afghanistan to recover property often become involved in complicated real estate disputes. Some have involved threats of retaliatory action, including kidnapping, and assassinations. Similarly, U.S. citizens involved in business or commercial disputes have been threatened with detention and imprisonment, and had their property seized to use as collateral. U.S. citizens have reported being physically attacked and family members have also been harmed as the result of such disputes. U.S. citizens who find themselves in such situations should not assume that either local law enforcement or the U.S. government will be able to assist them in resolving such disputes. Hiring a private attorney, early in the dispute, especially one who can act on behalf of the U.S. citizen in their absence, is recommended. Communications: Large parts of Afghanistan are extremely isolated and landline telephone communications remain limited. Cell phone service is unpredictable, and areas outside major urban centers suffer from irregular and weak signals. U.S. citizens in Afghanistan should always carry backup communications such as satellite phones or handheld radios, along with a vehicle/personal tracking device. Crime: Afghanistan is considered a critical threat environment for crime. Criminal organizations, including weapons and narcotics traffickers, undermine peace and stability throughout the country. Common petty or street crime exists, primarily in cities. Transient populations and internally displaced peoples may contribute to crime and lawlessness. Victims of Crime: U.S. Embassy Kabul suspended operations on August 31, 2021. The U.S. government is not able to provide any routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan, including victims of crime. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes committed in Afghanistan. The local equivalent to the U.S. “911” emergency line is “119” in Afghanistan. Please note that local operators do not speak English and that emergency services are restricted to the major cities. The emergency line may not be answered, and response times are usually longer than in the United States. Travelers should not expect or rely on significant assistance from local authorities in Afghanistan in resolving legal disputes. This is especially true for U.S.-based companies and their employees seeking local protection from extralegal efforts to resolve contract disputes. Property may be seized, and personnel may be detained as collateral pending the resolution of such disputes. Visit our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas for additional details. Tourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response services and subsequent appropriate medical treatment are very limited in-Afghanistan and may be entirely unavailable outside of major cities. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance that covers medical evacuation from Afghanistan. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .","For emergency services in Afghanistan, dial 119 or 100 for police; 102 for medical assistance; 112 for fire. Ambulance services are: Not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Not present throughout the country Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. Basic medical care is available in major Afghan cities but is limited in rural areas. Facilities vary in quality and range of services and are generally below U.S. standards. Doctors and hospitals often require cash prepayment for services. Western-style private clinics can be found in Kabul offering a variety of basic emergency and routine preventative-type care, but their hours are limited, and such facilities may not be suitable for complex trauma cases or severe medical emergencies. Individuals without licenses or medical degrees sometimes operate private clinics, and there is no public agency that monitors their operations. Travelers are strongly urged to obtain sufficient supplies of prescription and commonly used over-the-counter medications prior to arrival. Many U.S.-brand medications are not available in Afghanistan. Travelers should be aware that many pharmaceuticals found in Afghanistan are counterfeits, and the quality of locally produced medications is uneven. The U.S. government does not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not provide coverage overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health webpage and general Traveler Advice for Afghanistan. Select your destination in the Travelers’ Health webpage . Review all sub-sections including the Travel Health Notices, Vaccines and Medicines, Non-Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Stay Healthy and Safe, Healthy Travel Packing List, and After Your Trip. Review the Traveler Advice webpage that provide advice on medical considerations including: Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel) Travelers with Special Considerations (for example: Allergies, Long-Term Travelers and Expatriates) and General Tips (for example: Traveling with Medications, Travel Vaccines) Water Quality & Food Safety: In many areas of Afghanistan, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan will cover you outside of the United States, and that it specifically covers care when you are in Afghanistan. U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not provide coverage overseas. Many insurance companies consider Afghanistan to be an active warzone and specifically exclude coverage for individuals residing or traveling there. U.S. citizens are strongly recommended to obtain supplemental medical evacuation insurance as medical transport out of Afghanistan can be prohibitively expensive. When selecting a medical evacuation provider, be sure to confirm that the company offers such services in Afghanistan and obtain a list of clinics and hospitals that may be used as a medical evacuation point. Please note that the U.S. government cannot pay your medical bills. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: U.S. citizens in Afghanistan are subject to Afghan laws. A U.S. passport will not help you avoid detention or prosecution and may result in heightened attention by police and prosecutors, some of whom may seek to exploit your status as a U.S. citizen for financial or political gain. Persons violating Afghan laws, even unknowingly, may be fined, detained, imprisoned, or possibly executed. Penalties in Afghanistan can be more severe than for similar offenses in the United States. U.S. citizens may face the death penalty for crimes that would not be punishable by death in the United States. Photography of buildings/installations housing ministries, public sector institutions, and security forces, including equipment or troops, may lead to detention. Possession of alcohol is illegal and is equated to narcotics. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in alcohol or illegal drugs are severe, with offenders often facing long jail sentences and heavy fines. Sexual relations between unmarried couples, or unreported knowledge of such relations is punishable by lengthy prison sentences and/or public flogging in Afghanistan. Certain acts of U.S. citizens overseas are prosecutable as crimes in the United States, whether or not they are illegal under the local law. Withholding someone's identity documents, such as passports, green cards, or tazkeras, knowing that they are necessary for travel, can lead to criminal prosecution in the United States. For additional examples, see our page on crimes against minors abroad and visit the website of the U.S. Department of Justice . Religion and Islam: Islam, along with tribal law and customs (e.g., pashtunwali in predominately Pashtun areas), provides a foundation for Afghans’ lived experiences. The influence of tribal law and customs are greater in Afghanistan’s rural sector, compared to urban areas. Foreign visitors are expected to remain sensitive to Afghanistan’s Islamic and local cultures, and not dress in revealing or provocative manners, including the wearing of sleeveless shirts and blouses, halter-tops, and/or shorts. Proselytizing may be deemed an insult to Islam, and could result in severe punishments including – but not limited to – incarceration, and the death penalty. Committing a blasphemous act or producing or distributing material deemed critical of Islam is punishable by life imprisonment or the death penalty. Apostasy may carry a maximum penalty of death for Muslims who denounce Islam or convert to another religion. Allegations of conversion of Afghan citizens are taken particularly seriously. Accusations of blasphemy or insulting Islam, even when unproven, have led to deadly mob violence. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also have to pay fines and/or give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice’s website for more information. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad Financial Debts: U.S. citizens in Afghanistan have been detained in cases involving financial debts and contract disputes, as these disputes are generally considered criminal matters in Afghanistan. Hiring a local attorney in the early stages of such a dispute is recommended. Women Travelers: Afghanistan is a traditional country, particularly when it comes to gender roles and behavior. To help maintain a low profile, women should ensure their shirts cover their full arms, collarbone, and waistband, and their pants/skirts cover their ankles, especially when traveling outside Kabul. Almost all women in Afghanistan cover their hair in public; female travelers are advised to carry scarves for this purpose. Women are expected to be escorted by a male relative and can be detained for traveling alone. Women visiting Afghanistan should be alert of the risk of sexual assault and are recommended to review the Department of State’s travel tips for women travelers . LGBTQI+ Travelers: The Taliban consider consensual same-sex sexual activity to be a criminal offense, and representatives routinely enforced this position through violence, intimidation, harassment, and targeted killings. Conviction for same-sex sexual conduct is punishable by death, flogging, or imprisonment. Individual Taliban members made public statements reiterating that their interpretation of sharia includes the death penalty for homosexuality. LGBTQI+ individuals face discrimination, violence, and persecution in Afghan society. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Forced Marriage: The Department is aware of cases involving U.S. citizen women of Afghan heritage who have been convinced by their families to travel to Afghanistan, usually under the guise of visiting relatives, only to find themselves forced into marriage. The U.S. government considers forced marriage to be a human rights abuse and, in the case of minors, a form of child abuse. Forced marriage is defined as one in which one or both parties have not consented to the marriage (or are incapable of providing meaningful consent) and differs from arranged marriage. Often, victims of forced marriage are subjected to non-consensual sex, physical and emotional abuse, and isolation. Individuals who refuse a forced marriage may be threatened with violence or with being disowned by their families, who also often confiscate their belongings (including passports). Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Afghan law protects the rights of persons with disabilities, but the provisions are not implemented in practice. Persons with disabilities face limited access to transportation, public buildings, and hotels, and few communication accommodations. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and most buildings lack elevators. Banking: Access to banking facilities in Afghanistan is limited and unreliable. The economy generally operates on a cash-only basis, though the use of credit cards is becoming more common in larger cities. ATMs are available in major cities, but U.S. banks often deny transactions from Afghanistan unless a traveler provides advanced notice of the transaction. Customs: Afghan customs authorities generally enforce strict regulations on the import/export of certain goods such as alcoholic beverages, religious materials, antiquities, medication, precious stones and metals, and printed materials. U.S. citizen travelers have faced fines and/or confiscation of items considered antiquities upon exiting Afghanistan. Weapons/Firearms: U.S. citizens, including security contractors and military personnel, should carefully review Afghan import/export restrictions on weapons, firearms, and ammunition, including antique or display models. It is also important to review the regulations of any country through which you may transit, as many countries have strict rules prohibiting these items, even in checked luggage. Consult the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for information on traveling with such items into or out of the United States."
Albania,"Terrorism: Some terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.

Crime: Credit card fraud is common in Albania, and you should exercise caution by not letting your card out of sight when making a transaction. Visitors need to be very careful when using ATMs. Be alert for strangers looking over your shoulders at the PIN number, and also for any interference with the machine itself that could indicate a camera or card scanner that steals your details when you scan your card. Carjacking is rare in Albania, but vehicle theft may occur. Make sure your vehicle is locked and keep your possessions well hidden in the trunk. Recent crime statistics indicate a decrease in numerous violent crime categories to include attempted murder, robberies by force and armed robberies. Street crime is common in urban areas, predominantly at night. The most notable are burglaries, theft, and domestic violence claims. Attacks using small improvised explosive devices and targeting individuals in contentious disputes have occurred. Remain vigilant when parking in unattended parking areas, avoid parking overnight in non-secure areas, and inspect vehicles for suspicious items. If you find something strange, do not tamper with it and contact the Albanian Police immediately. Law enforcement’s ability to protect and assist travelers is limited in some areas, especially in remote regions. There has been targeted violence associated with illicit drug networks and organized crime countrywide. Travelers should remain aware of their surroundings and the extent of police and emergency services in their area. Demonstrations occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(355) 4 224 7285. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . The Embassy may be able to assist crime victims with the following: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S . Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is regulated, but rules may be unevenly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage. Professional and certified staff may not be available to support some organized activities. In the event of an injury, access to appropriate medical treatment may be sporadic due to limited hours or physical distances. Outside metropolitan areas, it may take more time to reach first responders or medical professionals who can stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .","For emergency services in Albania, dial 112 for an ambulance. Dial 127 or 128 for the Fire Department.

Health Facilities: The U.S. Embassy maintains information on doctors and hospitals here . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Adequate health facilities are available in Tirana and other cities but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Public medical clinics lack many basic resources and supplies. Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always accepted. Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient. Medical staff may not speak English. Generally, public hospitals are minimally staff overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions. Pharmaceuticals: Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Albanian law prohibits the import and export of narcotic medications and psychotropic substances. For more information, visit the General Directorate of Customs website . Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas In Albania, while many medicines are available without a prescription, certain pharmaceuticals may require a prescription from a physician and are sold only at specialized pharmacies. Some medications may not be available locally. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments recommended by a physician. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States.

Credit card acceptance is limited but ATMs are widely available in cities. Sporadic blackouts throughout the country can affect food storage capabilities. Tap water is not safe to drink. Air pollution is also a problem throughout Albania, particularly in Tirana. Establishing a business in Albania has been made easier through the establishment of the National Business Center, as a single one-stop shop for providing business registration and licensing services. These administrative services are done through simple electronic procedures, in a short time and with symbolic tariffs. Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTI events in Albania. Albanian law does not permit same-sex marriage and does not legally recognize other countries’ same-sex marriage certificates. The government does not prosecute or discriminate against same-sex relationships. Same-sex married couples cannot apply for family residency permits, but they may register individually.

Algeria,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists use simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds.  They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Terrorist Activity: Algeria has long been an important counterterrorism partner to the United States. It continues its aggressive campaign to eliminate all terrorist activity. However, active terrorist threats remain in Algeria and along its borders. In 2024, the Algeria reported nearly 53 counter-terrorism operations. These resulted in nine terrorists captured and 10 hideouts discovered and destroyed. Over the past five years, Algeria reported 24 major attacks. Almost all these terrorist attacks targeted Algerian security forces. Almost all involved improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or ambush tactics as suspects actively fled through rural mountainous regions. We warn U.S. citizens against travel to remote areas in southern and eastern Algeria. This is due to a high threat of terrorist attacks and kidnapping. As noted in our Travel Advisories for Algeria , U.S. citizens should: Avoid travel to rural areas within 50 km (31 miles) of the border with Tunisia and within 250 km (155 miles) of the borders with Libya, Niger, Mali, and Mauritania due to terrorist and criminal activities. Avoid overland travel across the Sahara. Travel to Saharan cities only by air. Remain on principal highways when traveling to coastal/mountainous areas east of Algiers and the mountains immediately south of Algiers. Always travel with reputable Algerian travel agents who know the area. Avoid staying overnight outside of the main cities and tourist locations. Inform local police when staying in locations outside of major cities. Active terrorist groups in Algeria include Al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Individuals who are inspired by and loyal to Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) are also active. These groups typically target Algerian government interests and security forces outside of major cities and mainly in mountainous and remote areas, but still aspire to target Western interests. Successful Algerian counterterrorism operations have limited AQIM, AQIM-allied groups, and ISIS capabilities. Recent incidents include: 2023 - Algerian soldier was killed in the Tissemssilt province flighting a terrorist group. The operation resulted in four terrorists arrested. 2020 and 2022 – Attacks targeting law enforcement facilities were prevented but killed and injured security forces. This occurred in the border regions of the southern wilayas of Bordj Badji Mokhtar and In Guezzam. June 2020 – AQIM claimed responsibility for the ambush of an army patrol in Ain Defla that killed one soldier. They also claimed an improvised explosive device (IED) attack in Medea that killed two soldiers. February 2020 – ISIS-Algeria claimed responsibility for an attack on an army outpost in Bordj Badji Mokhtar, near the border with Mali. The attack was done with a suicide vehicle borne improvised explosive device (SVBIED). It killed one Algerian soldier. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Algeria’s crime rate is moderate. Algeria has a very visible police presence throughout the country. Many plain-clothes police officers also exist. Petty theft and home burglary occur frequently in low-income areas. They also occur occasionally in affluent areas. Theft of contents and parts from parked cars, on trains and buses, and in hotel rooms occurs. Pickpocketing and purse snatching also occurs. In general, women face harassment in public if not accompanied by a male. Foreign women attract greater unwanted attention in public. International hotels generally provide adequate security. We have seen several cases in which U.S. citizen women meet an Algerian man online. They are then lured to Algeria for marriage and held against their will in abusive situations. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Algeria. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Tips to avoid scammers: Look for red flags like their location is far away, their profile was recently created or seems to be too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or they ask for money. Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages. Do a reverse image search on the profile picture. If they ask for help, you should refer to them to the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate so we can work with local authorities to assist. If you believe you have been scammed, report the incident to local law enforcement right away and stop all communications with the scammer. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Technology Usage Abroad: Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. GPS navigation apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. A GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety considerations. Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are. Meet in a popular public place. Avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy at (213) 770-08-2000. The crime emergency lines in Algeria are 1548 and 17; for gendarmes, call 1055.

Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage. Staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .","For emergency services in Algeria, dial 021711414.

It also criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual acts between adult men and women. The law includes imprisonment of six months to three years and a fine of DZD 1,000 to DZD 10,000 ($8 to $80). The law also includes imprisonment of two months to two years and fines of DZD 500 to DZD 2,000 ($4 to $16) for committing a “homosexual act.” If a minor is involved, the adult may face up to three years’ imprisonment and a fine of DZD 10,000 ($80). LGBTQI+ activists reported sweeping accusations that resulted in multiple arrests for consensual same-sex sexual relations. The arrests were permitted under the vague wording of laws criminalizing “homosexual acts” and so-called acts against nature. However, there were no known prosecutions during the past year. LGBTQI+ status is not criminalized. However, LGBTQI+ persons may face prosecution under laws disproportionately applied against LGBTQI+ individuals. These typically concern prostitution, public indecency, and “associating with bad characters”. NGOs report that judges give harsher sentences to LGBTQI+ persons compared to non-LGBTQI+ persons. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.

Angola,"Both spontaneous and planned civil disturbances and demonstrations, primarily related to governance and economic issues, can occur. U.S. citizens should avoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations, and maintain security awareness at all times. Landmines are a risk throughout the country outside major cities. Crime: Armed assailants have killed some victims of muggings, robberies, and car-jackings, which occur frequently in all areas of the country. In fall 2019, a rash of violent robberies ended in homicides in Luanda.  The most commonly used tactic involves two individuals on a motorcycle who follow their victim to rob, usually at gunpoint. Criminals also target women by themselves, driving or walking. Lastly, motorcycles staging an accident is a tactic used to get you to stop and to lure you out of your vehicle or allow the criminals to enter your vehicle allegedly to take them to the hospital. Vehicle thefts, purse snatching, and theft from vehicles occur in areas frequented by foreigners. Avoid walking alone, especially after dark, and displaying cash and valuable personal property like watches, jewelry, or smart phones. Vary your routes and travel times and let someone know your daily routine. Dress conservatively. Drive with doors and windows locked and windows rolled up. Keep valuables out of sight and do not use cell phones or laptops while stopped in traffic; criminals often brandishing guns use smash and grab tactics to steal valuables.

Argentina,"Demonstrations occur frequently in Buenos Aires and take place in other cities as well. Protesters often block streets and highways. Demonstrations are usually nonviolent, but always have the potential to turn confrontational.  Avoid demonstrations if possible. Crime: Street crime is a problem in most urban areas including Buenos Aires City, Buenos Aires province, Rosario, and Mendoza. Look out for muggers, pickpockets, scam artists, cellphone and purse-snatchers who work on the street, in restaurants and hotel lobbies, at bus and train stations, in public transportation, and in cruise ship ports. In Buenos Aires City, the (San Telmo, La Boca, Retiro, and Florida Street areas experience higher crime rates.) Areas outside of the city with higher levels of violent crime include Rosario, and the Buenos Aires suburbs of Lomas de Zamora, Quilmes, and Moreno. Although the La Boca neighborhood is a well-known tourist destination, there have been violent robberies in the daytime as well as nighttime. Stay on the main streets in the tourist zone and use radio taxis to and from the neighborhood. Avoid “villas” or shanty towns in Buenos Aires, other major cities, and provinces, even if they are in tourist zones. Frequent robberies of luggage and handbags occur at Retiro bus station in Buenos Aires,  the bus station in Mendoza, and when leaving a handbag in the overhead compartment on the bus. Robberies: Robberies involving motorcycles (called “motochorros”) occur frequently in cities. These thieves normally operate in pairs:  one operates the bike, an the other jumps off and takes the watches, purses, and backpacks of pedestrians. The motochorros also reach, or break, into cars to snatch valuable items. Robberies involving drugs that incapacitate victims are becoming more common in Argentina. Thieves use dating apps to schedule “dates,” at a hotel room or private residence and then drug and rob the victim. Individuals have also been drugged at bars when socializing with strangers.  Criminals identify potential drugging victims in bars, night clubs, or through dating apps. Consider meeting in a public area and always be cautious of accepting drinks from people or allowing others to have access to your drink. Be cautious when using ATMs. While withdrawing funds, victims are forced to take out as much money as possible and sometimes at different locations, maxing out their cards at each location. Foreigners in Argentina have been the victims of kidnapping for ransom schemes. The victim is typically held for ransom and family members or co-workers are contacted to bring all the cash they have on hand or can gather in a couple of hours.  Once the ransom is paid, the victim is usually released unharmed. Fake telephone kidnappings are also common. The U.S. Embassy receives many reports of stolen passports.  Passports and other valuables should be locked in a hotel safe.  Carry a photocopy of your passport with you.  In addition, U.S. citizen residents and visitors should safeguard personal information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, banking and other information, to protect against identity theft Robberies occur often, and violence is more likely to occur when victims resist. Do not leave your personal belongings unattended Taxi Scams: Scams involving yellow and black taxis have been reported at international airports and around Buenos Aires. Pre-arrange a ride or select one of the flat-rate “remise” services (private car with driver) from the airport service counters. In town, use radio taxis from places like a hotel when possible.  See the Department of State and the FBI Financial Crime I pages for information on scams.  A few common scenarios follow: Drivers pretend to help tourists with money while trading good bills for counterfeit ones. A “handler” at the airport accepts payment for the ride, but then the driver also demands money at the end of the ride. The taxi “breaks down” on the road, and a second taxi comes to get the passenger.  Both drivers demand payment. Spraying mustard or another substance on the tourist from a distance.  An accomplice robs the victim while pretending to help clean the stain. Protestors (‘piqueteros’) sometimes block major roads during large protests and can cause significant traffic delays. General Precautions: Do not place handbags on the back of your chair or on the floor at a restaurant.  Keep them in your lap. Do not leave your drink unattended. Do not leave cellphones on tables at restaurants. Avoid openly displaying your cell phone Travelers should not pack valuables in checked bags. Avoid using ATMs in unfamiliar, secluded, or lightly protected areas. Climbing, Hiking, and Trekking: Do not trek alone. The U.S. Embassy in Argentina strongly discourages U.S. citizens from hiking alone or even separating from larger traveling parties while on a trail. In recent years, U.S. citizens and other foreigners have disappeared or been seriously injured while solo climbing/hiking and trekking. Sexual assaults have been reported against solo hikers and bikers on trails in regions along the border with Chile.  Hike in groups and remain alert to your surroundings . Follow Park Ranger and Search and Rescue Team advice and instructions. Update your SOS or GPS emergency locator information. Make sure your device is enabled to function in the park and your provider has the correct information for authorities. Add local rescue teams as your first emergency contact (see recourses below) and add the U.S. Embassy’s emergency contact phone number as an alternative: +54-11 5777-4354. Before your trip check the following resources for reliable information about trail conditions and potential hazards in the most popular climbing, hiking and trekking regions in Argentina: Mendoza: Mendoza, Aconcagua Bariloche: Club Andino El Chalten: El Chaltén We strongly recommend that before you travel you purchase supplemental travel and evacuation insurance, provide family or friends with a detailed itinerary prior to climbing, trekking, and hiking, and register your itinerary through the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP).

Armenia,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.

Aruba,"Crime: Crime against tourists consists primarily of theft. The main targets are valuables left unattended in public areas (beaches, cars, hotel lobbies, etc.). Purses, cameras, passports, phones, and other handheld electronics are the most frequently stolen items. Take normal precautions to secure personal property. Do not leave valuables in cars in plain view or unattended in unsecured hotel rooms and rental homes. Keep a copy of your U.S. passport in a secure location in case the original is lost or stolen. Incidents of violent crime, including rape and armed robbery – although not common – do occur. Exercise caution when visiting more isolated areas of the island. There is an increased risk of crime in the San Nicolas district, especially at night. Crimes against tourists are more common here. Car theft, especially of rental vehicles, can occur. Vehicle leases and rentals may not be fully covered by local insurance when a vehicle is stolen or damaged. Be sure you are sufficiently insured when renting any item. The legal drinking age of 18 is not always enforced, so extra parental supervision may be appropriate. Take standard safety precautions when frequenting nightclubs and bars. Travel in pairs or groups, and, if you consume alcohol, do so responsibly. To avoid spiked drinks, do not leave your drink unattended or accept open containers from strangers. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Dial 100 for police assistance in Aruba. Dial 911 if you need emergency medical assistance in Aruba.

In the event of an injury, basic emergency medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. Critical injuries often require medical evacuation. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","Access to quality medical care is limited in Aruba, and facilities may not offer the health and service standards typically expected in the United States.

Military Service : Azerbaijan has mandatory military service for male citizens ages 18 to 35. If Azerbaijan considers you a citizen, you could face fines or arrest if you have not completed your military service. Dual citizen males ages 18 to 35 have been prevented from departing Azerbaijan on U.S. or Azerbaijan passports – until they resolved military service requirements with the Azerbaijan government. The U.S. Embassy in Baku cannot resolve this issue for affected individuals. Information regarding Azerbaijan’s mandatory military service, including contact information, can be found on Azerbaijan’s State Service for Mobilization and Conscription website .

Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) individuals are not specifically protected by antidiscrimination laws. Societal intolerance, discrimination, and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity remain a problem in Azerbaijan. It is not illegal to organize events in support of LGBTQI+ persons, but societal intolerance generally prevented these events. LGBTQI+ individuals have reported that employers sometimes found other reasons to fire LGBTQI+ employees due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. One of the main concerns for local LGBTQI+ persons is the perceived failure of law enforcement agencies to act on violations of the rights of LGBTQI+ persons and indifference to investigating crimes committed against LGBTQI+ persons in Azerbaijan. The Department of State’s Human Rights Report documents incidents of police brutality against individuals based on sexual orientation and notes that authorities did not investigate or punish those responsible. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities : Azerbaijani law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but accessibility for persons with disabilities is limited throughout the country. Expect accessibility to be limited in transportation, lodging, and general infrastructure. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips .

Bahamas,"Crime: The Department of State rates the criminal threat level in New Providence Island (includes Nassau and Paradise Island) as critical. The vast majority of crime occurs on New Providence (Nassau) and Grand Bahama (Freeport) Islands. Criminal activity on the outlying Family Islands does occur, but to a much lesser degree than on New Providence or Grand Bahama. In Nassau, exercise caution in the “Over the Hill” area (south of Shirley Street). Violent crime such as burglaries, armed robberies, and sexual assaults occur, but generally not in tourist areas.

Adventure Tourism: Activities involving commercial recreational watercraft, including water tours, are not consistently regulated. Watercraft are often not maintained, and many companies do not have safety certifications to operate in The Bahamas. Reconsider going on the water in rough seas or inclement weather, as accidents and fatalities have occurred in such conditions. U.S. citizens seeking to engage in adventure tourism-related activities, including boat tours, are strongly encouraged to confirm the following with any tour operator: Credentials and certification to operate in The Bahamas Liability in the event of an accident Safety and rescue protocols for guides Jet-Ski Operators: Jet-ski operators have been known to commit sexual assaults against tourists. As a result, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to use independently operated jet-ski rentals on New Providence and Paradise Islands. Watersports Advisory: Carefully assess the potential risks of recreational water activities and consider your physical capabilities and skills. Be aware of sharks when in or on the water, as shark bites do occur and can result in serious injury or death. Never venture out alone, particularly at isolated beaches or far out to sea. Avoid entering the water above your waist if you have been drinking and always be mindful of jet ski and boat traffic in the area. Do not engage in water activities during times of inclement weather or rough seas. Commercial watercraft operators have discretion to operate their vessels regardless of weather forecasts; injuries and fatalities have occurred. Hurricanes: Hurricane season generally runs from June through November, although hurricanes can occur outside that period. Monitor local weather reports closely. Airports and seaports cease operations well before a predicted storm arrives, and seats on most commercial transportation may sell out far in advance. For more information on hurricane preparedness, please refer to the Department of State’s page on Crisis Abroad and the U.S. Embassy Nassau’s Hurricane Preparedness page. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","Medical care is available on New Providence and Grand Bahama islands. However, serious illnesses or injuries might not be treatable locally. Serious health problems requiring hospitalization and/or medical evacuation to the United States can cost tens of thousands of dollars in up-front costs. Outer islands have only small clinics, and medical care is limited. Ambulance service is available on the major islands, but traffic congestion on New Providence Island can cause delays. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.

The possession or use of illegal drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy, is a criminal offense in The Bahamas and can result in time in prison. While visiting The Bahamas, you are subject to Bahamian law. Drug violators are regularly arrested, even for possession of small quantities . All persons 16 years of age or older in The Bahamas are tried as adults in court.

Do not accept packages from people you meet during your stay. Firearms, Ammunition, and other weapons are not permitted in The Bahamas . According to The Bahamas Firearms Act, individuals found to have a firearm or ammunition in their possession without a legally issued Bahamian gun license face a penalty of up to 10 years’ incarceration and $10,000 fine.  Declaring the weapon in your luggage with an airline carrier does not grant permission to bring the weapon into The Bahamas.

Bahrain,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime : The crime rate in Bahrain is low, and violent crime is rare. Thieves and pickpockets are known to operate in the old market area. Common sense security precautions are effective in countering the threat of crime. Demonstrations occur regularly in specific areas and are usually peaceful and not disruptive to public order. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, during international events, at night and on weekends. Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Demonstrations sometimes result in temporary road closures.  Demonstrators occasionally burn tires, throw rocks, or lob Molotov cocktails in specific neighborhoods at night.  In the past, they have used improvised explosive devices and shotgun-like projectile launchers against government security forces.  The Ministry of Interior maintains official checkpoints and will deploy crowd control agents against demonstrators if it is determined that the protest is becoming unruly or could impact public security.  In recent years, dialogue and community policing elements have been used to lower tensions and crowd control measures have been deployed as a last resort. No U.S. citizens have been specifically targeted during protest activity. Local media outlets have sometimes expressed anti-U.S. sentiment, and demonstrators have occasionally burned U.S. flags. Remain alert to local security developments. For assistance, call the local police at 999. Restricted travel: The U.S. Embassy restricts its employees from traveling to specific areas where protest activity is more likely and advises all U.S. citizens to do the same. See the Embassy’s website for travel restrictions and security updates . International Financial Scams : See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Technology Usage Abroad: Mobile devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated, and using virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based.  Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using GPS apps, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety considerations. Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 999 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(973) 1724-2700 (business hours) or +(973) 1727-5126 (after hours).  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .","For emergency services in Bahrain, dial 999. Ambulance services are: Widely available but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health webpage and general Traveler Advice for Bahrain. Select your destination in the Travelers’ Health webpage.

The Department of State strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with Customs Affairs of Bahrain to ensure the medication is legal in Bahrain. Most narcotic painkillers, stimulants, and controlled sedatives/hypnotics are not easily available, and may be illegal. Do not bring CBD oil or products to Bahrain. Basic medical care is available through public and private hospitals, as well as private clinics. In some facilities, the care is below U.S. standards. Public hospitals have trauma and Intensive Care Units. Most postoperative and trauma centers do not provide adequate pain management. People with chronic general medical or mental health conditions and HIV-related health issues may not be able to obtain U.S standards of emergency care in Bahrain. U.S. privacy and confidentiality laws may not apply to Bahraini medical providers. Infectious Disease Considerations: The Kingdom of Bahrain has strict rules on persons in country with HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B or C. Treatment for these conditions is not available locally. Expatriates are subject to deportation or expulsion from Bahrain if medical authorities discover evidence of their status, even if they are well controlled on medication or do not require treatment.

Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Embassy officials can more readily visit you while you are still being detained at a police station than after you have been transferred to a prison. See our webpage for further information and our embassy website for a list of local lawyers. Extra-marital sexual relations are a criminal offense. If a child is born out of wedlock, obtaining a civil birth certificate is extremely difficult and, while rare, may lead to the deportation of the mother and the child. Without a birth certificate, obtaining a passport for the child can be difficult. Additionally, transmission of citizenship is typically through the father which could lead to the child being stateless. In the case of U.S. citizen mothers, the embassy may be able to document such children as U.S. citizens or may be able to process an immigrant visa petition. Consult the embassy for options, but it is advisable to depart the country before giving birth. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs are severe , including long jail sentences and heavy fines. You can be arrested for public drunkenness and disorderly behavior. Penalties for driving under the influence include imprisonment and/or heavy fines. Any sign of alcohol consumption may be taken as evidence of driving under the influence. Using vulgar language or hand gestures can result in heavy fines or criminal charges. It is illegal to photograph certain buildings in Bahrain. Always carry a form of identification with you , such as a passport, local ID card (CPR card), or driver’s license. Child Abduction and Custody Cases: There are no treaties in force between Bahrain and the United States concerning international parental child abduction and custody cases. Bahraini courts may ignore child custody decrees issued in the United States. Sharia law generally controls custody issues. Decisions are often based on age and gender of the children rather than the U.S. “best interest of the child” standard. Social Services: Information concerning family and child services can be found on the Ministry of Labor and Ministry of Social Development websites. Divorce: Seek legal counsel and ascertain your rights in Bahrain before visiting the country if you are a U.S. citizen divorced from/in the process of divorcing a Bahraini citizen. This is particularly important regarding child custody issues. See our website on Bahrain and international child abduction for additional information.

Bangladesh,"The U.S. government assesses that there remains a credible terrorist threat against foreigners in Bangladesh.  U.S. citizens in Bangladesh should take precautions, remain vigilant, and be alert to local security developments. There has been no significant terrorist attack in Bangladesh since March 2017, but the country remains a target of several foreign terrorist organizations.  Since 2015, ISIS-affiliated terrorists have conducted over 30 attacks that targeted foreigners, religious minorities, and local police/security services.  In March 2017, ISIS claimed responsibility for at least three bombings in multiple locations in Bangladesh, including two suicide attacks that targeted security forces near Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport.  The third bombing transpired during a police raid against suspected terrorists, killing seven onlookers and injuring 40.  In July 2016, ISIS attacked a Dhaka restaurant frequented by Westerners, killing 20 hostages, including a U.S. citizen.  If you observe high-profile police activity, depart the area immediately. Al-Qa’ida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) retains a presence in Bangladesh; the group last carried out attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed several secular bloggers, publishers, and human rights activists; a U.S. citizen was among the victims. The following groups, including several on the U.S. government’s list of designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, are active in Bangladesh: Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS), known locally as Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB or “Neo-JMB”) Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), known locally as Ansar al-Islam Lashkar-e-Tayyiba Indigenous sectarian groups U.S. government personnel in Bangladesh live, work, and travel under strict security guidelines and are prohibited from: Traveling on foot (walking, running) and biking outside of designated areas and times; Traveling via non-registered rickshaws outside designated areas and times; Traveling via commercial ride-share services, public buses, or compressed natural gas autorickshaw (CNG); Visiting public establishments outside of designated areas and times without prior notification; and Attending widely-publicized large gatherings, including events at international hotels,. Tourism: The tourism industry is nascent, unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are often not identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to provide urgent medical treatment.

Ambulance services are widely available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. COVID-19 Testing: PCR and/or antigen tests are available for U.S. citizens in Bangladesh. The government of Bangladesh has provided a list of recommended COVID-19 testing facilities for international passengers here . Those wishing to get tested will have to pay for their own COVID-19 test.  Results are often delivered via text message and are, in most cases, linked to a QR code. COVID-19 Vaccines: The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Bangladesh. The Government of Bangladesh started its national COVID-19 vaccination program in January 2021. The program includes AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Sinopharm, and Sinovak vaccines. The Government of Bangladesh is now offering COVID-19 vaccines to those who do not have a Bangladesh national ID (NID) or a locally registered birth certificate, including all foreign nationals. Individuals who have yet to receive a vaccine are encouraged to call the Bangladesh Health hotline at 16263 to identify the nearest vaccine center.  Please carry a passport or another form of government-issued identification and be ready to provide a Bangladeshi mobile phone number. Those who do not have an NID or locally registered birth certificate may not register for a vaccine via the surokkha.gov.bd vaccine portal, and as a result, would be unable to receive a Bangladeshi vaccine certificate with a QR code. Anyone vaccinated at a vaccine center, however, will receive a handwritten vaccine card to carry as proof of vaccination against COVID-19. Those interested in obtaining a booster dose may follow the procedure described above and should be ready to present proof of previous vaccination against COVID-19. Individuals become eligible for a booster dose four months after their last dose is administered. This information is also available at the Directorate General for Health Services website . If any U.S. citizen wishes to register through the Surokkha website to get the QR coded vaccine certificate, they should follow the instructions below and provide the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka with all the required information so that we can forward it to the Bangladesh Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the purpose of vaccination against COVID-19. Visit the FDA’s website to learn more about FDA-approved vaccines in the United States. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Medical Insurance: Make sure health insurance plans provide coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on overseas insurance coverage. We strongly advise supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Medical Care: Though quality of care is below U.S. standards, most common illnesses can be treated locally. U.S. citizens often travel outside Bangladesh for routine surgical procedures and complicated medical treatment. A centrally coordinated medical emergency response system is not available. A list of hospitals and doctors in Dhaka can be found on the U.S. Embassy website. Bangladesh has no prohibitions on specific medications. Always carry prescription medication in original packaging with a doctor’s prescription. The sale of counterfeit medications has been reported, but medications from major pharmacies and hospitals are generally reliable. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the past few years, a large number of both Chikungunya and Japanese Encephalitis cases has been reported. You should consider the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine for prevention. Dengue is endemic in Bangladesh and during the 2019 summer season, increased cases are being reported as compared to the last 5 years. Should you develop symptoms of fever, headache, rash, or muscle/joint aching, you should seek medical attention early in your illness. Malaria is reported in 13 districts in the northeast and southeast regions of Bangladesh. If planning travel there, you should consult with your physician regarding taking medication for malaria prophylaxis. The CDC also considers Bangladesh an area with risk of Zika infection, though it is uncommon. Pregnant women, travelers with a pregnant partner, and women considering becoming pregnant should speak to their healthcare provider about possible Zika risk before travel. Prevention is key: Regular use of insect repellent and long garments is recommended as protection against mosquito-borne illness. Water supplies in Bangladesh are non-potable. Bottled drinking water is generally safe for consumption. Foodborne illnesses are common. Wash, soak in sanitizing solution, peel, and thoroughly cook all food to minimize chemical, bacterial, and parasitic contamination. Air quality in Dhaka is consistently poor and especially hazardous from November to March. We recommend avoiding prolonged outdoor exposure during these months. N95 filtration masks/respirators that are NIOSH certified are helpful, but you need to have a good fit and seal when using them. Current Dhaka air quality can be found here .

We can provide help and advice if you are being forced into a marriage against your will. Please refer to our information on forced marriage . All travelers to Bangladesh, including Bangladeshi citizens, should maintain possession of their passports and return plane tickets to ensure independence to travel. Registration for Renters: The Bangladesh Government requests biodata and other personal information from all residents. This registration is mandatory for renters but is voluntary for homeowners and foreigners. Dual nationals, former Bangladesh nationals, and “No Visa Required” seal holders are considered Bangladeshi for registration purposes. Property Disputes: Land disputes are common in Bangladesh and are extremely difficult to resolve through legal channels. We cannot protect personal property and cannot take sides in a legal dispute. If you wish to purchase property in Bangladesh be aware of the risks including those of not being physically present to oversee your property. Natural Disasters: Heavy flooding occurs during the monsoon season (June to October), and 30 percent of the country may be under water. Lightning strikes are common during the monsoon season and outdoor activity should be avoided during storms.  Landslides can also occur during heavy rains, particularly in the hill tracts area of the Bandarban district in the southeast. Cyclones occur most frequently in the pre-monsoon (April and May) and post-monsoon (October and November) seasons and could include wind speeds of up to 150 km/hr and storm surges of up to 5 meters. Bangladesh is at severe risk from tornadoes. Bangladesh is in a zone 2B earthquake fault region, with a moderate probability of damaging ground motion. The overwhelming majority of structures in Bangladesh would not withstand a moderate earthquake. Although earthquakes are more likely to occur in the north of the country, destruction from an earthquake is expected to be most acute in urban areas. Post-earthquake disaster relief capabilities are extremely limited. You should make contingency plans for travel in Bangladesh. Leave emergency contact information with family members outside of Bangladesh and enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program ( STEP ). General information about natural disaster preparedness is available from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and at Ready.gov . For more information on disaster preparedness, please visit: U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) FEMA: Earthquakes FEMA for Kids: Emergency Preparedness U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Earthquake Preparedness Ready.gov: Tornadoes Travel.state.gov: Crisis and Disaster Abroad Fire Safety: Fires in residential and commercial buildings are not uncommon in Bangladesh, and first responders' capacity to control flames is limited. Many multi-story residential buildings and shopping malls lack proper fire extinguishers, emergency exits, among other fire safety features. Stay aware of your surroundings and emergency exits.

Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Rights: Consensual same-sex sexual activity is criminalized in Bangladesh and penalties include up to life imprisonment. See our LGBTQI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. In 2016, AQIS specifically targeted and killed two prominent members of the Bangladesh LGBTQI+ community in their apartment because of their human rights activism and sexual orientation. Persons with Mobility Issues: Public transportation, sidewalks, many buildings, and most public areas are not wheelchair accessible."
Barbados,"Crime: U.S. citizens are not specifically targeted for crime in Barbados. However, crimes of opportunity such as petty larceny, burglary, automobile break-ins; as well as incidents of violent crime, such as murder, sexual assault, robbery, shootings, and drug related crimes do occasionally occur. As you would in any major metropolitan area of the U.S., use the below personal security measures while traveling: Do not leave valuables unattended in public areas, on beaches, unsecured in hotel rooms, or in rental homes. Avoid walking alone, especially at night, on beaches, and in isolated or poorly lit locations. Go out in groups or with a companion and limit nighttime activities to established safe and reputable venues. Use only clearly marked taxis and avoid rides with strangers. Stick to well-lit and well-traveled routes. Avoid displaying flashy jewelry, expensive electronics, and large amounts of cash. Be aware of your surroundings at all times. If you see something suspicious or unusual contact local police at #211 to report immediately. Use added caution when shopping in crowded areas, especially during the holiday season. Use added caution when attending crowded events, such as Crop Over, Kadooment celebrations, music festivals, etc. Do not leave drinks unattended in public venues as this could create a potential vulnerability for the use of “date rape” drugs in furtherance of criminal activity. Do not be predictable; vary your daily routes and schedules. Prostitution and drug use (to include marijuana) is illegal, do not engage in illegal activity. Do not wear camouflage as it is illegal to wear in public. For boaters: Be wary of unfamiliar persons or crafts approaching your boat, whether at anchor or at sea. In Barbados exercise extra vigilance at night on party cruises and in the downtown area. Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods. These are illegal in the United States, and you may also be breaking local law. Firearms: Do not enter Barbados with firearms or ammunition without prior express consent from the Barbados government. Please contact the Embassy of Barbados with questions regarding travel with firearms. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 211 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (246) 227-4000. The emergency lines in Barbados are: Fire: 311, Police: 211, Ambulance: 511. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .

Watersports Advisory: Carefully assess the potential risks of recreational water activities and consider your physical capabilities and skills. Never venture out alone, particularly at isolated beaches or far out to sea. Avoid entering the water above your waist if you have been drinking and always be mindful of jet ski and boat traffic in the area. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, hospitals are able provide urgent medical treatment, though very serious injuries often require medical evacuation. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","Medical care is good for the region, but medical transport can take hours to respond, and ambulance attendants are prohibited from applying lifesaving techniques during transport. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do not apply overseas. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of Barbados to ensure the medication is legal in Barbados. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. The following diseases are present: Chikungunya Dengue Zika Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs or firearms are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. It is illegal, even for children, to wear camouflage clothing or carry items made with camouflage material. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Firearms: Do not enter Barbados with firearms or ammunition without prior express consent from the Barbados government. Please contact the Embassy of Barbados with questions regarding travel with firearms. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers : Same-sex sexual relations, even when consensual, are criminalized in Barbados. Although this law is rarely enforced, potential penalties include life imprisonment. See section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details . Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Access to buildings, pedestrian paths, and transportation is extremely difficult for persons with mobility issues. Sidewalks (if they exist) are very uneven and will only occasionally have ramps at intersections. Pedestrian crossings are also very infrequent and can be poorly marked. Buses and taxis do not have special accommodations. The Town and Country Planning Department set provisions for all public buildings to include accessibility infrastructure. As a result, many new buildings have ramps, reserved parking, and special sanitary facilities. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips .

Belarus,"Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks. All European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Demonstrations intended to be peaceful can sometimes become confrontational. For this reason, it is recommended that U.S. citizens avoid all demonstrations and protest gatherings. Demonstrations, both organized and spontaneous, are infrequent in Belarus. Localized street disturbances relating to political events are more likely in Minsk or larger cities than in smaller towns and villages. Authorities have used force to disperse demonstrators, including those who are peacefully demonstrating. Bystanders, including foreign nationals, may face the possibility of arrest or detention . Foreigners may be placed under surveillance . Hotel rooms, telephones, and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in problems with authorities; these sites are not always clearly marked and application of these restrictions is subject to interpretation. Crime: Belarus has a low rate of street crime. Violent crime against foreigners is rare; criminals have been known to use force if met with resistance from victims. Common street crime, such as mugging and pickpocketing, occurs most frequently near public transportation venues, near hotels frequented by foreigners, and/or at night in poorly-lit areas. Exercise caution when visiting bars, casinos and night clubs, and do not leave your drink unattended. There have been reports of travelers being drugged and subsequently robbed or assaulted while visiting night clubs. Prostitutes at hotels may attempt to open hotel room doors in search of customers. Local and transnational organized criminal activity exists in Belarus. Most casinos and adult clubs are operated by criminal elements and should be avoided. Theft of vehicle parts and car vandalism is common. Sport-utility and luxury vehicles tend to be the most sought-after. Parking in a secure area overnight is highly recommended. Internet-Dating Schemes and Cyber-Crime: ""Internet brides"" are advertised on several websites and are not always legitimate. Often, potential suitors in the United States lose thousands of dollars sending money to people they have never met and will never hear from again. In some cases, the foreigner is invited to visit Belarus; the Belarusian “friend” collects money for lodging and transportation expenses and then disappears. Cyber-crime is well developed in Belarus. Merchandise orders with fraudulent credit cards, ID theft, hacking/blackmail schemes, and advance-fee fraud are gaining in popularity. If doing business electronically with persons or firms in Belarus, proceed with extreme caution. Use only ATMs located inside major banks. Use of credit and debit cards is not recommended; there have been reports of U.S. citizens having their ATM or credit cards skimmed resulting in fraudulent charges or money stolen from their accounts. Be aware that due to a lack of tourism infrastructure in Belarus, transferring funds from abroad, replacing stolen traveler's checks or airline tickets, or canceling credit cards can be difficult in Belarus. Counterfeit and pirated goods are widely available. Transactions involving such products may be illegal under local law. In addition, bringing them back to the United States may result in forfeitures and/or fines. Sophisticated criminal investigations may be inconclusive because of a lack of resources and/or political will. We have received reports of harassment of U.S. citizens at border crossings. We recommend that you report any crimes immediately to the local police and to the U.S. Embassy in Minsk. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing 102 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +375 17 210 1283. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime that occurs in Belarus. The local equivalents to the “911” emergency lines in Belarus are: 101 for Fire and Rescue Squad; 102 for Police; and 103 for Ambulance (Medical Emergency).

Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","Medical care in Belarus is neither modern nor easily accessible. Hospitals and medical facilities are below U. S. standards and lack basic supplies. Trauma care is well below U.S. standards; Belarus lacks the level of care and competence to deal with serious injuries. Standard U.S. health insurance plans are not accepted in Belarus. Ambulances are poorly equipped and unreliable . It is not unusual to wait 30 minutes for an ambulance. Consider purchasing medical evacuation insurance prior to traveling to Belarus. There are no air ambulance services in Belarus. The government requires all visitors show evidence of valid purchase health insurance . You may purchase local health insurance at your point of entry. The medical emergency number for Belarus is 103 We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Medical Insurance: The government requires all visitors to purchase local health insurance or show evidence of a policy with international coverage that includes Belarus. You may purchase the local health insurance at the points of entry. If you plan to use international medical insurance purchased outside Belarus, be sure to check with the Embassy of Belarus to be sure your policy is acceptable. See our webpage for more information on overseas insurance coverage . We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover a potential medical evacuation. If traveling with prescription medication: You must carry your prescription medication in the original packaging You should have the written prescription from your doctor. You should check with the government of Belarus, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure your medication is legal in Belarus. Some common medications in the U.S., such as opioid pain relievers, are illegal in Belarus. Belarusian officials have confiscated these drugs from travelers. The following diseases are prevalent: Tuberculosis (TB) is an increasingly serious health concern in Belarus. For further information, please consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) information on TB . Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Under local law, any agency that detains a foreigner should inform the local Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) within 24 hours from the time of detention. The MFA, in its turn, must notify the respective embassy as soon as possible. The time of such notifications has varied from several hours to several weeks. Therefore, we recommend that if travelers have a chance to inform friends or relatives about their arrest, they should request that their friends or relatives notify the U.S. Embassy on their behalf as soon as possible. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES Currency: Belarusian banks provide limited cash withdrawals in Belarusian rubles from major credit cards. Please see notes on cyber-crime, above, regarding the security of ATMs. Authorized currency exchange centers are widely available throughout major cities. It is a criminal offense to exchange payment in U.S. dollars to firms or individuals without a special license. Only a few large firms are licensed to accept U.S. dollars . Travelers are advised to only use widely available licensed exchange locations. ATMs are available for use; credit and debit cards are widely accepted in major cities and towns; however use caution (see cyber-crime above). Identification: Carry your passport at all times. Police have the authority to stop you and request identification. If you fail to provide your ID, you may be detained by the police until your identity is established. Radiation: The 1986 release of nuclear material from the Chernobyl nuclear station in Ukraine affected Belarus. The city of Minsk was mostly spared, but other areas of Belarus were badly contaminated. Several years of monitoring have shown that radiation levels in Minsk are within internationally acceptable standards, and periodic testing of foodstuffs from various locations in Belarus has not revealed a level of radiation that would be considered harmful. Marriages in Belarus: Consult the U.S. Embassy Minsk website for information on getting married in Belarus . Marriages must be performed at a registrar’s office (ZAGS- Office of Matrimonial Acts Registration) to be legally valid in Belarus. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: Same-sex relations are not illegal in Belarus, but discrimination against members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBTI) community is widespread, and harassment against LGBTI individuals has occurred in the past.

Belgium,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad, including possible attacks in Europe. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, rudimentary IEDs, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, concerts, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks/festivals Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and airports/scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Low-level street crime including robberies, smash and grab car robberies, purse snatchings, stealing electronics, and pickpocketing is common, particularly in major cities, in public areas such as restaurants, the Brussels metro at night, buses/trams, and all train stations. Thieves often operate in teams, by bumping into or shoving the target, especially in crowds. Be alert to distractions. Theft from vehicles is common. Always drive with your windows up and the doors locked, as thieves sometimes target cars stopped at traffic lights. Thieves may smash the window and grab valuables. Use parking garages when possible, and if you must use street parking, look for a spot near a street light. Do not leave anything visible on the seats, floor, or dashboard. Theft of bags on trains has increased, particularly the Brussels-Amsterdam route. Thieves often target light bags placed overhead. Keep bags with cash, valuables, and travel documents close to you, rather than in the overhead shelf on trains. Carry only a minimal amount of cash, credit cards, and necessary personal identification. Avoid wearing expensive jewelry and watches. Demonstrations occur frequently . They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Police routinely monitor protestors and demonstrations. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Monitor the Embassy website for demonstration alerts. International Financial Scams: U.S. citizens have lost tens of thousands of dollars in scams in Belgium. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for more information. Common internet scams include confidence schemes, in which friends, family, or others receive a message that a U.S. citizen traveler is stranded in Belgium and in need of funds to pay for customs fees. U.S. citizens in the United States who have been victimized by Internet crime should report it to the Internet Crime Complaint Center . Check ATMs or other machines for skimmers or removeable readers. When possible utilize bank ATMs. In bars and restaurants, have the card swiped in front of you and do not let it be taken away.

Belize,"Belize is rated high for crime and has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world. Gang members and other criminals use violent means to resolve disputes. Visitors should exercise caution throughout Belize, particularly in the south side of Belize City and remote areas along Belize’s borders due to high crime. Crime: Crime may occur anywhere in Belize, and criminals frequently target tourists, including those at resorts and on the roads and river ways. Crime, including sexual assault, armed robbery, and murder remains high and is distributed evenly throughout the country. Sexual harassment and/or assault of persons traveling alone or in small groups have been reported. Most crimes remain unresolved and unprosecuted. A lack of capacity, resources, and training impedes the ability of local police to effectively investigate crime and apprehend offenders. Thefts of cash and credit cards happen frequently in some areas of Belize. It is believed several credit card fraud rings are currently active in Belize, particularly in San Pedro. Scams occur in Belize, especially in resort areas. Tourists, in general, are particularly vulnerable to these crimes, resulting in visitors being pick-pocketed, robbed and/or extorted. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at 822-4011. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. While the Embassy stands ready to assist the Belize authorities with any requests for technical assistance, the Embassy is not a law enforcement agency, cannot provide U.S. citizens with protection or investigate crimes against U.S. citizens, and has no jurisdiction to intervene in police or judicial processes.

LGBTI Travelers: The Belizean government in September 2016 conceded the decriminalization of homosexuality, but is questioning a section of a July 2016 Supreme Court ruling that made “sexual orientation” a protected class. The Immigration Act prohibits “homosexual” persons from entering the country, but immigration authorities have not enforced that law. There continues to be significant hostile sentiment towards individuals who identify themselves as LGBTI. Tourist friendly areas, including San Pedro Town, Ambergris Caye, remain relatively open and welcoming to the LGBTI community. Outside of these areas, LGBTI persons, especially males, are reluctant to display affection in public (including holding hands) because incidents of verbal or physical assault have been reported. There have been some instances of violence reported against LGBTI individuals, and LGBTI groups have reported that the police at times refused to accept reports of crime from LGBTI persons. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of the Department of State's Human Rights report for further details.

Benin,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected and focused on vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Extremist groups have carried out attacks in areas of Burkina Faso adjacent to Benin’s northern border, near Park Pendjari, Park W, and adjacent hunting zones. Attacks may occur with little or no warning. Western tourists have been kidnapped in Park Pendjari in northern Benin. U.S. government employees are restricted from personal travel to Park Pendjari, Park W, other areas within 50 km of Benin’s northern border with Burkina Faso, and areas north of the RNIE 7 route from Banikoara to the Nigerian border (not including the cities of Kandi and Segbana). The U.S. Department of State recommends tourists reconsider travel to these areas. For more information, see our terrorism page. Crime: Street crime is a significant problem in urban areas. Robbery and muggings occur on major thoroughfares and in neighborhoods, including those where expatriates and diplomatic staff live, where popular bars and restaurants are located, and on the beaches near hotels frequented by international visitors. Most reported incidents involve the use of force, by armed persons, with minor injury to the victim. There have been reports of individuals impersonating police officers.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. People starting a business or practicing a licensed profession should seek information from local authorities. They need to do this before practicing or operating. Bolivian authorities are generally required to press official charges within 24 hours of arrest. They must release a detainee within 48 hours if no formal charges are brought. However, investigative and pre-trial periods may drag on indefinitely . Bolivian law lets police detain any foreigner. They can detain them until they show proof of legal status in the country. This proof can be a passport, visa, or residency card. Though this is rarely enforced, anyone who cannot produce proof of legal status may be detained until legal status is confirmed. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. In Bolivia, you may find products made with wild plants and animals. Many of these products could involve protected or endangered species, whose sale and export are illegal. Bolivian authorities could seize any protected species that is sold or transported. This applies to live animals or products, like food, drinks, leather, crafts, or clothes. Some products, including live animals, require special permits to leave Bolivia. Knowingly importing into the United States wildlife or plants that were taken from the wild or sold in violation of the laws of Bolivia (or any other country) violates U.S. law. Arrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. In Bolivia, suspects can be held up to 18 months without charges. The detention period can then be extended beyond 18 months. Legal cases often drag on for years. Mountain Trekking and Climbing Safety : Many popular trekking routes in the Bolivian Andes are at 16,000 feet or higher. No matter your medical history or fitness, the high altitude may harm you. Exercise extreme caution when trekking or climbing in Bolivia. Trekkers must have enough clothing and gear. These are not always available locally. They should be experienced in the mountains. Don’t trek alone . Join an organized group and/or use a reputable firm to obtain an experienced guide and porter. If you develop a severe headache, weakness, vomiting, shortness of breath at rest, cough, chest tightness, or unsteadiness while climbing, descend to a lower altitude right away. Also, consider seeking medical attention. Trekkers and climbers should buy insurance. It should cover emergency services, like medical evacuations. Satellite communication and internet connectivity can be limited or non-existent. Inform family members of your plans and note that you may not be reachable for extended periods. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods : Counterfeit and pirated goods are common in many countries, but they may still be illegal under local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information.

Bosnia and Herzegovina,"Terrorism :  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking soft targets and are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, rudimentary explosive devices, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Violent incidents : Local criminals use firearms and explosives to settle disputes, with the majority of incidents involving improvised explosives in Sarajevo occurring after dark. The foreign community is rarely targeted, but collateral damage can occur. See LGBTQI+ Travelers, below, for information regarding recent violent incidents targeting members of the LGBTQI+ community. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime : The overall crime rate for the country is high, and Sarajevo has a high rate of property-related crime. The most common criminal activities in Sarajevo are robberies, residential break-ins, vehicle break-ins and theft, and pickpocketing. Pickpocketing occurs in areas frequented by tourists in Sarajevo. Be alert at all times, especially after dark and in locations frequented by tourists, such as cafés, parking garages, shopping areas, and restaurants. Take normal precautions to protect your property from theft and employ personal security measures, such as traveling in groups and staying in well-lit areas after dark. Avoid carrying large sums of money. People wearing backpacks stand out and attract the attention of pickpockets. Landmines : Landmine explosions have injured over 1,200 and killed over 600 people in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1995. Minefields, active landmines, and unexploded ordnances are a threat throughout the country and deaths from explosions have occurred as recently as March 2023. Stay on hard surfaced areas and out of abandoned buildings.  Observe mine warning signs throughout the country.  Consult with the latest landmine maps via the Bosnia and Herzegovina Mine Action Center . Regardless of an area’s mine status, avoid unmarked trails. For more information about landmines and unexploded ordinance, please visit the website of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Mine Action Center . Demonstrations can occur anywhere in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international or sporting events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Large demonstrations, even if peaceful, can create traffic congestion and lead to closures of public transportation, roadways, and sidewalks. Soccer matches : Rival fans occasionally fight and cause property damage and physical injuries. Plan ahead to avoid the area. Physical confrontations surrounding soccer matches have included  right-wing nationalist, racist, or anti-LGBTQI+ violence. Large groups of soccer fans can quickly become violent. Avoid crowds and large groups. Large crowds before and after matches can create significant traffic congestion, crowding at drinking and eating establishments, and problems for pedestrians. Road and sidewalk closures are common. Feral dogs : Avoid stray dogs. Packs or individual dog attacks occur in urban and rural areas and can be unpredictable.

Botswana,"CRIME: Non-confrontational crime and crimes of opportunity, primarily the theft of money and personal property, are common. Home invasions, break-ins, “smash and grabs” from vehicles at intersections and from locked cars in shopping mall parking lots, cell phone thefts, and muggings - often at knife point, are routinely reported to police. Hotels and lodges are not immune from criminal activity. Visitors should remain alert and take reasonable precautions to safeguard personal property (particularly money and electronic equipment). Crime is also reported in game parks, nature reserves, and remote areas frequented by tourists. You should: avoid walking alone, particularly at night exercise caution near Kgale Hill (a popular hiking site) in Gaborone due to frequent criminal incidents; promptly comply if confronted by criminals as resistance may result in severe injury; avoid crowds, political rallies, and demonstrations; always maintain security awareness. Travelers arriving in Botswana via South Africa should be aware of serious and continuing baggage pilferage problems at OR Tambo (Johannesburg) and Cape Town International Airports. It is suggested that you: use an airport plastic wrapping service; avoid placing valuables in checked luggage; make an inventory of items in checked baggage to file claims if theft does occur; if asked to gate check a piece of hand luggage, transfer high value items and prescription drugs into a carry-on bag. Travelers transiting and staying overnight in Johannesburg before departing for Botswana should exercise vigilance when departing the airport as foreigners have been the victims of “follow home” robberies.

Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Botswana prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication/access to services/ease of movement or access. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. The government mandates access to public buildings and transportation for persons with disabilities, but civil society sources report access for persons with disabilities is limited. Many privately owned buildings and business, and older government buildings remain inaccessible. The law does not specifically include air travel with other modes of transportation but in general, persons with disabilities are provided access to air transportation.

Brazil,"Crime: The violent crime rate is high in most Brazilian urban centers. Public transportation, hotel sectors, and tourist areas report high crime rates, but these incidents can happen anywhere and at any time. Be aware of your surroundings. Do not travel to: Informal housing developments in Brazil (commonly referred to in Brazil as favelas, vilas, comunidades, and/or satellite cities), even on a guided tour, at any time of day due to crime. Neither the tour companies nor the police can guarantee your safety when entering these areas. Even in favelas that the police or local governments deem safe, the situation can change quickly and without notice. In addition, exercise caution in areas surrounding favelas, as occasionally, inter-gang fighting and confrontations with police move beyond the confines of these communities. Brasilia’s administrative regions (commonly known as “satellite cities”) of Ceilandia, Santa Maria, Sao Sebastiao, and Paranoa during non-daylight hours due to crime. Any areas within 150 km of Brazil’s land borders with Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Paraguay due to crime. (Note: This does not apply to the Foz do Iguacu National Park or Pantanal National Park.) Consider avoiding the use of public, municipal buses in Brazil at any time of day, and especially at night. Crime trends indicate an elevated risk of robbery or assault on public bus systems throughout Brazil. The U.S. government recommends against personnel using public, municipal buses in all parts of Brazil. U.S. citizens in Brazil should be alert to the widespread use of sedatives to drug and rob individuals, including incidents involving U.S. citizens and many more involving other tourists. According to reports, the victims believe their drinks were tampered with. They report that they have very little recollection of events and realized their valuables were missing after losing and regaining consciousness. While victims continue to be randomly targeted in bars and nightclubs, foreigners are also targeted through online dating applications. We recommend taking the following steps to avoid this type of crime: Avoid going to bars or nightclubs alone and avoid leaving with strangers. Do not accept food or drinks from strangers. Before going on a date with someone you met on a dating app, tell a loved one who you are meeting, where you are going, and the details of the dating application account. Be wary about inviting individuals to your residence. If inviting a new acquaintance to your residence, speak to your door attendant in advance about your invited guest. Trust your instincts – if something does not feel right or if you suddenly feel ill, walk away from the situation. If you believe you may have been drugged, seek immediate medical attention. Some people can have life-threatening reactions to these drugs. After that, report the crime to local police and contact us at the numbers listed below. In addition, be aware of the following situations: Traveling Outside Metropolitan Areas After Dark: Travelers are encouraged to organize their trips so that they can travel during daylight hours. Road conditions throughout Brazil can vary widely, and travelers must exercise caution due to debris in the road, horse-drawn carriages, unmarked speed bumps, and other infrastructure deficiencies. Armed hold-ups of pedestrians and motorists can happen, including at or near public beaches. Personal belongings, left unattended even for a moment, are often taken. If you are robbed, hand over your personal belongings without resisting. Resisting will increase your risk of injury. Carjackings and hold-ups can occur at any time of the day or night, especially at intersections and in tunnels. Some robberies involve individuals robbed at gunpoint and taken to make purchases or to withdraw as much money as possible from one or more ATMs. Crime on public transportation occurs. Registered taxis have red license plates and openly display company information and phone numbers. Credit card fraud and ATM scams are common in Brazil. Work closely with your financial institutions to monitor accounts and keep your credit card in view while it is scanned at a point of sale. Avoid using ATMs in unfamiliar, secluded, or lightly protected areas. Be aware that criminals often target ATMs and businesses in the early hours of the morning when there are fewer witnesses and law enforcement response times may be delayed. If you opt to use an ATM, select those that are located inside of secure facilities, such as an airport, hospital, bank, or government building. Avoid openly displaying your cell phone.  When using a ride share service or taxi, wait for its arrival in a secure area. Avoid large groups or events where crowds have gathered. Public events of any nature, including concerts and sporting events, can unexpectedly turn violent. U.S. government employees working in Brazil are not permitted to: Travel to any areas within 150 km of the international borders with Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Paraguay, except in limited circumstances with the appropriate U.S. Department of State approvals. Individuals with ties to illegal criminal networks operate along Brazilian borders. Travel to the Foz do Iguaçu National Park and Pantanal National Park is permitted. Enter any informal housing developments in Brazil (commonly referred to in Brazil as favelas, vilas, comunidades, and/or satellite cities), except in limited circumstances with the appropriate approvals. Enter Brasilia’s administrative regions (commonly known as “satellite cities”) of Ceilandia, Santa Maria, Sao Sebastiao, and Paranoa during non-daylight hours. To reduce the chance of becoming the victim of a crime, in addition to the above recommendations, please review the below precautions: Limit the personal belongings you carry with you. Carry your money in your front pockets and limit the number of credit cards you carry. Make copies of all of your personal documents – including your credit cards, license, passport, etc. – and keep them in a safe place. This will be helpful if you lose your documents. Do not carry or wear valuable items that will attract the attention of thieves. If you need to wear expensive jewelry or carry a camera, conceal it until you arrive at your destination. Be aware of the street environment and avoid contact with those who may be looking for robbery targets. Seek a safer location. Go into a store, bank, or simply cross the street. Do not walk on beaches after dark. Assaults are common. Use increased caution when hiking in isolated areas, particularly near popular tourist locations in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Demonstrations and strikes are common in urban areas, may occur unexpectedly, disrupt transportation, and may escalate into violence. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Check the website of the Embassy or Consulate nearest you for current information on demonstrations. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of crime should contact the local authorities to file a Brazilian police report before departing Brazil. In most instances, you can report crimes to the tourist or civil police. U.S. citizens should also inform the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate, but local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are inconsistent. Inquire with property management about the presence and functionality of safety equipment, such as fire alarms and carbon monoxide detectors. Hazardous areas/activities are normally identified with appropriate signage in major urban centers but may not be in other locations. Tourism industry staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate and timely medical treatment is consistently available only in or near major cities. First responders can face delays accessing areas outside of major cities to quickly provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage","COVID-19 Testing: Brazil is a very large, diverse country with varying medical resources, both private and public, throughout the country. Many private labs perform COVID-19 testing at various prices, typically between $20 and $100.  PCR, serology-based antibody tests, and antigen tests are available.  Turn-around time varies widely depending upon location. Please verify turn-around time with your chosen lab before taking the test.  Express results within 2-4 hours are available in many locations at an increased fee, including in the Guarulhos International Airport in São Paulo and Galeão International Airport in Rio de Janeiro. Testing is available in the private sector without a doctor’s prescription, but a prescription may be required for insurance payment. In the public healthcare system, each Brazilian state has its own COVID-19 testing plan. We recommend that you contact local/state authorities for more information. Typically, a COVID-19 test is ordered by an emergency room physician and then sent to a public lab. Turnaround time is much slower and can take up to seven days, but tests are generally free.  Information on testing sites and procedures is available through the official app of the Ministry of Health. COVID-19 Vaccines: The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Brazil once they register with the public Unified Health System (SUS) . According to the Ministry of Health, available vaccines include AstraZeneca/Oxford (Fiocruz), CoronaVac (Butantan), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), and Pfizer (BioNTech). For more information on local availability of COVID-19 vaccines, please see the Brazilian Ministry of Health’s website and also contact local health authorities . For emergency services in Brazil, dial 192. Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except in state capitals and other large cities. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on overseas insurance coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the Government of Brazil to ensure the medication is legal in Brazil. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though the yellow fever vaccine is not required to enter Brazil, travelers wishing to be vaccinated should consider receiving it prior to travel, as local supplies are limited. Please note that the yellow fever vaccine should be administered ten days prior to travel for it to be effective. Also note that, while yellow fever vaccine is not required to enter Brazil, some neighboring countries (French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana, Bolivia, and Paraguay) do require travelers with recent entries in Brazil to show proof of yellow fever vaccination. All travelers to the country are advised to carry documentation, such as a vaccination card, that they have been appropriately vaccinated for yellow fever. The following diseases are prevalent in Brazil: Chagas Chikungunya Dengue Zika Leishmaniasis Rabies Travelers' diarrhea Tuberculosis Schistosomiasis In recent years, outbreaks of these diseases have also been detected in certain areas of Brazil: Yellow fever Measles Polio Elective Surgery : Although Brazil has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Brazil, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified. Some “boutique” plastic surgery operations offer luxurious facilities but are not hospitals and are unable to handle emergencies. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Brazil. Non-traditional Medicine: Several U.S. citizens have died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners in Brazil. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities if seeking such services. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulate immediately. See our webpage for further information. Firearms: Brazil forbids importing, exporting, and possessing firearms without prior authorization of the Brazilian Government. U.S. citizens are subject to arrest and prosecution in Brazil for possession of unauthorized firearms or firearm components anywhere in the country, including airports. This prohibition extends to spent shell casings or ammunition, even if inside luggage during transit, regardless of whether those items were legally purchased in the United States or elsewhere. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Water Hazards: Many of Brazil’s beaches have very dangerous riptides, even if the water looks safe. Ocean currents and waves are unpredictable, even in popular beaches frequented by tourists. Shark attacks are reported in the waters of some beaches in northeastern Brazil, particularly near Recife. Always observe posted warnings and never swim while under the influence of alcohol. Follow local authorities’ guidance and refrain from swimming alone in areas marked with red warning signs or at beaches where there are no municipal lifeguards or first responder services. Electricity Blackouts: Power failures in large urban centers are common and sometimes followed by increased crime. Most tourist hotels are equipped with generators, minimizing the impact of a blackout, but you should remain cautious. Natural Disasters: Flooding and mudslides occur throughout the country and can be fatal. Monitor news and weather reports and adhere to municipal advisories before traveling to areas prone to flooding or landslides. Many of Brazil’s larger cities have frequent heavy rainstorms that cause flash flooding and can disrupt traffic. Customs Restrictions : Contact the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, D.C. or one of Brazil's consulates in the United States for specific information regarding import and export regulations. Please also refer to our information on customs regulations . Brazilian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporarily importing or exporting items such as firearms, antiquities, mineral samples, tropical plants, wildlife, medications, and business and communication equipment. In the Amazon region, there is special scrutiny of exporting biological material. People raising, growing, or exporting biological materials without permits can be charged with “biopiracy.” Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: Brazil does not have legal restrictions on same-sex marriage, relations, or events coordinated by LGBTI organizations.

Bulgaria,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) The U.S. Department of State has assessed Sofia as being a LOW-threat location for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: U.S. government personnel are not prohibited from traveling to any specific areas of Bulgaria due to crime. Most criminal acts in Bulgaria take place in Sofia. Other districts with a slightly lower level of crime than Sofia are Varna, Plovdiv, Burgas, and Stara Zagora. The lowest crime levels are in the districts of Smolyan, Kardzhali, Vidin, Silistra, and Razgrad. Most of Bulgaria experienced a decrease in crime in 2021 compared to 2020. ATM skimming, credit card fraud, and traffic incidents remain the most common threats to U.S. citizens in Bulgaria. Majority of incidents involving U.S. citizens are monetary in nature, though incidents of racism, ethnic slurs, and harassment of African Americans and religious minorities have occurred. Report crimes to the police by dialing 112. Pick pocketing and purse snatching are frequent occurrences, especially in crowded markets, on shopping streets, near airport ATMs and aboard the busy tram and bus lines. Con artists often operate on public transportation and in bus and train stations. Use caution at ATMs . Be wary of people who approach you at an ATM and offer assistance. Do not give your PIN to anyone under any circumstances. Police stations should provide translators for anyone who needs to report a crime but will often require the victim to return at a later time or bring his/her own translator. Use taxis with meters and clearly marked rates displayed on a sticker on the passenger side of the windshield. Taxi drivers are known to overcharge unwary travelers particularly at Sofia Airport, the Central Train Station, and at Black Sea resort areas. The airport has a clearly marked exit within the arrival terminal that leads travelers to metered taxis at a fair rate and a booth to assist with obtaining taxi services. Inquire about the fare before entering a taxi and always account for all luggage, packages, and hand-carried items before paying and releasing a taxi. Popular mobile application based taxi services like Uber or Lyft do not operate in Bulgaria, but there are local taxi services that use similar mobile applications such as Yellow Taxi and Taxime. Automobile theft and break-ins are common in residential areas and in parks. Four-wheel-drive vehicles and late-model European sedans are the most popular targets. Burglary is a common crime. If you plan to reside in Bulgaria on a long-term basis, take measures to protect your home and consider installing window grilles, steel doors with well-functioning locks, and an alarm system. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on significant holidays, and during international events. They mainly occur in downtown Sofia in the areas surrounding and between Parliament and the Presidency. Demonstrations can be unpredictable; even those intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Exercise caution if unexpectedly found in the vicinity of large gatherings or demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. In an emergency, U.S. citizens should call the police (#112), seek a safe location, and wait for assistance. Messages regarding demonstrations are posted on the Embassy's website .","For emergency services in Bulgaria, dial 112. Ambulance services are widely available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Adequate health facilities are available at some hospitals in major cities, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Hospitals and doctors require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Medical staff may speak little or no English. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Not every hospital/clinic in equipped for pediatric care. If you need emergency services for an infant/child, please call ahead to ensure those services are available. The U.S. government does not pay medical bills .  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Credit card payment is not always available. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Bulgaria’s Customs Agency to ensure the medication is legal in Bulgaria. Vaccinations :  Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Air Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the winter. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens People over 65 years of age People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema People with heart disease or diabetes People who work or are active outdoors Health Facilities: The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals in Bulgaria. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery. Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Bulgaria. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Bulgaria. Although Bulgaria has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Bulgaria, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified. Pharmaceuticals Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with few controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients.  Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States.  Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States.  Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for use in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy : If you are considering traveling to Bulgaria to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our ART and Surrogacy Abroad page . Surrogacy is illegal in Bulgaria. For additional information, visit the Government of Bulgaria’s website for information on foreigner surrogacy.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit, and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Bulgaria are severe; convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail. Bulgarian law enforcement authorities may take you in for questioning if you take pictures of certain government buildings, embassies, or military facilities. Special Circumstances: Bulgaria is still largely a cash economy, especially outside of major cities. You may exchange money at local banks or exchange bureaus. Be wary of people on streets offering to exchange money, they are usually con artists who intend to swindle unsuspecting travelers. Damaged or worn U.S. dollar bank notes are often rejected at banks or exchange bureaus. Most shops, hotels, and restaurants do not accept traveler's checks. Credit cards may not be accepted outside the major cities. Local banks such as Unicredit, Bulbank, Bulgarian Postbank, and United Bulgarian Bank (UBB) can cash travelers’ checks. Corruption remains an important concern of the Bulgarian government. You may refer complaints of public corruption by e-mail to the Ministry of Justice at anticorruption@justice.government.bg or by phone to +359 2 987 0697. All grievances must be submitted in the Bulgarian language. If you plan to import an automobile to Bulgaria, be aware that customs duties on personal vehicles can be high. All documents must be originals or certified copies and contain an apostille. See more information on the Bulgarian Customs Agency website. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details : : Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTQI+ events in Bulgaria. However, LGBTQI+ individuals face cultural stigma and widespread discrimination. LGBTQI+ individuals engaging in public displays of affection may attract unwelcome attention or harassment. According to LGBTQI+ organizations, courts rejected the right of same-sex partners for protection against domestic violence because the law treats “spousal” only as applying to married persons who cannot legally be the same sex. The Commission for Protection against Discrimination reported receiving very few cases regarding sexual orientation. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section six of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: Bulgarian law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities in employment, education, and access to health care, but societal discrimination persists. Bulgarian law requires improved access to buildings for persons with disabilities and new public projects take this requirement into account, but authorities rarely enforce this law in older buildings. Commuting in Bulgaria is very difficult for disabled individuals. Buses, trams, and trolleys generally lack accommodation for disabled travelers. The Sofia metro is the most accessible system for disabled individuals, but its transportation network is limited to Sofia. Disabled travelers should consider traveling with a friend or family member who can assist them in navigating the transportation systems in Bulgaria.

Burkina Faso,"See the Department of State’s Travel Advisory for Burkina Faso and Worldwide Caution for current security information. Terrorism: Violent extremist elements, remain active in Bukina Faso and throughout the region. They have specifically targeted Westerners in attacks and kidnappings. Since January 2016, extremist groups have conducted numerous cross-border attacks in the Sahel region. In addition to attacking police stations, customs offices, military posts, and schools in the Sahel region, extremists have attacked Ouagadougou three times since Janaury 2016. On March 2, 2018, extremists attacked the French Embassy and Burkina Faso’s military headquarters in downtown Ouagadougou. Eight security force personnel, including soldiers and police officers, were killed, and over 80 others were injured. In August 2017, a small group of armed men attacked the Aziz Istanbul Café, a restaurant in downtown Ouagadougou, and killed approximately 19 people. Civil Unrest: Demonstrations may occur throughout Burkina Faso with little or no advance warning. Maintain a surplus of supplies including food, water, fuel, and medical supplies in case you need to shelter-in-place. U.S. citizens should remain vigilant and utilize appropriate personal security practices, including: avoiding large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations; maintaining situational awareness and exercise good judgment; remaining alert and aware of your surroundings; staying abreast of current events through media outlets. Crime: Street crime is prevalent in major cities and foreigners are often directly targeted. Cellular telephones, jewelry, laptops, money and other items of value are the frequent targets of thieves. The majority of street crime is committed after dark and is often perpetrated by one or two individuals on motorbikes. Street crime typically increases in Ouagadougou around the holidays, the bi-annual West African Movie Festival (FESPACO), and the bi-annual Regional Craft Festival (SIAO). Remain vigilant in crowded areas and secure your personal belongings are at all times. Avoid traveling alone after dark as security risks increase at night. Be alert and aware of your surroundings, travel with a group of people if possible, and avoid poorly lit streets and narrow alleys. Criminals in urban areas may carry a knife or sharp weapon in order to cut the straps on bags, purses, or backpacks and can become violent if the victim resists. Ordinarily, thieves do not threaten victims with weapons, although there have been thefts and attempted thefts involving firearms and knives. Residential thefts/home invasions occur occasionally in the Ouagadougou expatriate community centered in Ouaga 2000, Koulouba, and Zone du Bois, and in other parts of Ouagadougou. Thieves enter residences at night but generally avoid direct confrontation with the occupants. Most perpetrators exploit an unlocked door or window. Travel in convoys when outside of major urban areas to deter roadside crime. Robberies can take place anwhere along the country’s roads, but local police cite the Eastern Region beyond Koupela, toward Fada N’Gourma due to its isolated location and intermittent cell phone coverage. According to police statistics, more than half of all reported roadside robbery incidents occurred in the this area. Criminals often use spotters at highway checkpoints and bus stations to identify potential victims. While criminals mainly steal valuables, they may physically harm victims during the course of a robbery. Exercise caution when traveling along the northern areas of the country near the Mali and Niger borders. The Government of Burkina Faso and the U.S. Embassy have limited ability to provide assistance in the Sahel Reserve region. The U.S. Embassy has placed restrictions on official government travel to Dori, Djibo, the east-west road that connects these cities, and all areas north of that road . U.S. citizens are encouraged to follow the same guidance. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 10-10 and contact the U.S. Embassy.

Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips. Women Travelers: Although the law prohibits violence against women, domestic violence, including spousal abuse, is widely reported. Wives have limited legal recourse in cases of abuse. There is no reliable data on the extent of sexual assault though it is a problem. Rape cases are usually not sent to trial. Police generally investigate reports of rape, but victims often do not file reports due to cultural barriers and fear of reprisal. The law prohibits Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting, but it is practiced widely, particularly in rural areas, and usually performed at an early age. See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Early Marriage: The legal age for marriage is 17 for girls and 20 for boys, but child marriage is a problem. The law prohibits forced marriage. Polygyny is permitted, but a woman must agree to it prior to marriage."
Burma,"Messages regarding security-related events are posted on the Embassy’s website . Fighting between the Burma’s military forces and ethnic armed groups and militia forces continues in border regions, including parts of Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Shan, Rakhine, and Chin States, and as well as in Sagaing and Magway in the center of the country. Travelers should avoid travel to these areas. The destinations frequented by most U.S. citizen visitors, including Rangoon, Bagan, Ngapali Beach, Naypyitaw, and Mandalay, are not currently affected by this fighting, but the security situation can change quickly. See our Travel Advisory for more information. Land mines and unexploded ordnance: Conflict-affected areas are of greatest concern, particularly areas of Shan, Chin, and Kachin States. The location of landmines is often not marked or otherwise identifiable. The regime’s Ministry of Hotels and Tourism publishes information on restricted areas. Due to travel restrictions placed on U.S. diplomats by the de-facto authorities, our ability to assist U.S. citizens affected by incidents in remote and/or conflict-affected areas of Burma may be limited. Crime: Crime rates in Burma, especially involving foreigners, are lower than those of many other countries in the region. Nevertheless, the crime rate has been increasing, particularly home burglaries and petty crime. Violent crime against foreigners is rare, but there have been incidents involving attacks by taxi drivers and muggings. Citizens are advised to take particular care when taking taxis late at night. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for more information. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 199 or in person at the police station in the district where the crime took place; and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(95) (1) 7536-509, ext. 4240, Emergency After-Hours Telephone: +(95) 1 7536-509.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

Disaster Preparedness Cyclones and Tropical Storms: Cyclones may occur in two, three-month seasons peaking in May and November, respectively, during which travel conditions may deteriorate significantly. In addition, intense rainfall and squalls may occur during the rainy season (approximately June to October annually). Travelers are encouraged to prepare for cyclone emergencies and monitor local news stations when cyclones are forecast. The Myanmar Department of Meteorology and Hydrology has a color-coded system for storm systems: red for storms approaching landfall in Burma, orange for storms moving towards Burma, yellow for developing storms, and brown for current storms. Additional information on storm preparedness may be found on our Crisis and Disaster Abroad webpage. Earthquakes do occur throughout Burma. Check here for information about earthquake preparedness . The Department of Homeland Security’s page has numerous resources on emergency kits, preparing for disasters and developing emergency plans: https://www.ready.gov/. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","For emergency services in Burma, dial 119.

Ambulance services are: not present throughout the country or are unreliable. not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Given the above information, injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. Most medical facilities in Burma are inadequate for routine medical care. If you are seeking medical care in Burma, you will be asked to pay cash for all health care services and medicines before receiving care; credit cards are not accepted in most health care facilities and insurance will not be billed. Adequate Emergency Medical Services including ambulance care is not reliably available. Patients who are admitted to public hospitals typically need a family member or friend to assist them with care in the hospital, and food and medical supplies must be purchased for use in the hospital. Few medical personnel in Burma are trained to U.S. standards. U.S. citizens needing urgent medical care have been denied treatment at public hospitals due to a lack of funds. In an emergency, you would likely need to be medically evacuated to a hospital outside Burma . Medical evacuation from Burma is expensive and is most often transacted in cash, therefore medical evacuation insurance is advised. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation (see above). Medication: Many pharmaceuticals on sale in Burma are counterfeit or adulterated, or may not be available. Travelers should consider Burmese pharmaceuticals generally unsafe to use and should bring their own medications for the duration of their stay in Burma. If traveling with prescription medication, check with these authorities to ensure that the medication is legal in Burma.  Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our webpage on crimes against minors abroad and the U.S. Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.  See our webpage for further information. Should you be detained, especially outside of Rangoon, we may not be able to assist quickly. Law enforcement officials do not routinely notify us of the arrest of U.S. citizens, and prison officials have been known to obstruct regular access by consular officers to U.S. citizen detainees. Dual Nationality: Burmese law forbids Burmese citizens from possessing dual nationality. On occasion, Burmese authorities have detained and pursued criminal proceedings against Burmese-Americans who have returned to Burma on U.S. passports and who have had in their possession evidence of Burmese citizenship, such as a National Registration Card. Tourists Must Reside in a Registered Hotel or Guesthouse: Burmese law requires that foreign tourists reside in registered hotels or guesthouses. Criminal penalties, including multiple years of imprisonment and deportation, apply for non-compliance. Illegal drugs carry severe penalties. Expect long jail sentences under harsh conditions, heavy fines, or even execution for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs. Insulting Religion: Under Burmese law, insulting religion is a prosecutable offense. ‘Insult’ is a very broad term that could include tattoos or other religious representations in a non-religious context.  Images of the Buddha can be particularly sensitive. In 2016, a tourist was deported for allegedly having a tattoo of the Buddha on his leg. In 2020, a Facebook user from Meikhtila who criticized monks on social media was sentenced to over a year imprisonment; two other individuals were arrested for drawing graffiti of a skull wearing a monk’s robe. As in any country, visitors are encouraged to be respectful of local customs when visiting religious sites. Drones: Importing unmanned aerial systems (drones) without prior permission from authorities and flying them in sensitive areas can result in criminal penalties, including jail time and the permanent confiscation of the drone. Sensitive areas include government buildings, famous tourist sites, and religious buildings. Because it is rarely clear what constitutes a sensitive area, all recreational use of drones is inadvisable.  Multiple foreigners have recently been detained for flying drones in sensitive locations. Social Media: You may be prosecuted for posting negative or derogatory comments on social media, including Facebook, under the 2013 Telecommunications Law, which criminalizes “extortion of any person, coercion, unlawful restriction, defamation, interfering, undue influence, or intimidation using a telecommunications network.” If convicted, you may face a fine and/or imprisonment. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: Consensual same-sex sexual activity is illegal under section 377 of the Burmese penal code, which has provisions against “sexually abnormal” behavior and entails punishments up to life imprisonment. Laws against “unnatural offenses” apply equally to men and women. These laws are rarely enforced; however, LGBTQI+ persons have reported police using the threat of prosecution to extort bribes. LGBTQI+ activists have also reported allegations of rape by security forces in some cases, arbitrary arrest (for example for loitering), detention, and broad societal and familial discrimination. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights Report for further details.

Ramps or handicapped-accessible facilities are rare. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Burundi,"See the Department of State’s Travel Advisory for Burundi . Incidents of violence occur. Grenades and small arms have been used in some acts of violence in Burundi. Armed groups opposed to the Burundian government operate in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and have in the past launched attacks inside Burundian territory. DRC armed forces and UN peacekeepers continue to conduct combat operations against rebels, militia, and ISIS-aligned groups in Eastern DRC. As a result, Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces, and the portion of Bujumbura Rural province that borders DRC, are vulnerable to armed violence. Armed actors may also exploit porous borders and forested areas between Burundi and Rwanda and the DRC for illicit activities. U.S. Embassy personnel follow increased security protocols when visiting the following areas: the provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke, and Kibira National Park (including the park’s southernmost part in Muramvya province), even when just transiting through the park to reach Kayanza via RN-10. Searches: Security forces routinely search vehicles and homes, including those of foreigners and U.S. citizens. Residential searches are routine and generally occur between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.; police must present identification and a warrant. Report improper searches to the U.S. Embassy. Roadblocks: Police maintain checkpoints throughout the country. Travelers have reported harassment, bribe solicitations, intimidation, and (though rare) physical violence, especially during heightened security situations. If stopped: Be compliant, calm, and courteous. Identify yourself as a U.S. citizen. Remain in your vehicle. Provide copies of identification documents if requested and attempt to keep originals. It is common practice for police to retain personal or vehicle identification documents in return for a ticket to ensure payment. Documents are returned following payment of the fine at Emmaus Pathway on Blvd Mwanbutsa or at other approved locations. Do not drive away until instructed to do so. Report harassment to the U.S. Embassy. Crime: Crimes of opportunity (mainly for financial gain) are the most reported incidents of crime against U.S. citizens in Burundi. In recent years, there have been two incidents of violent crime against U.S. citizens. Most criminal incidents involve theft, burglary, and robbery. Petty crime may be more likely in public places. Criminal elements do not typically single out U.S. citizens, but may view them as targets of opportunity based on perceived affluence or vulnerability. U.S. citizens should take these precautions: Keep doors and windows closed and locked (at home and in vehicles). If threatened, particularly by an armed assailant, do not refuse or resist—your life is worth more than your belongings. Prior to your departure, tell someone where you are going and when you expect to be back. Avoid being out alone late at night. Exercise caution when carrying and/or displaying possessions, especially valuable ones. Demonstrations occur occasionally. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Precautions: Carry original and color photocopies of your U.S. passport and visa at all times. Avoid large public gatherings. Even events intended to be peaceful can turn violent. Be vigilant against petty crime. Monitor news and consular alerts .

Air pollution is a moderate problem in several major cities in Burundi. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling, if appropriate. Respiratory issues have been reported more frequently when the air quality is worse, particularly in the drier months. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens. People over 65 years of age. People with lung disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. People with heart disease or diabetes. People who work or are active outdoors. Health facilities in general Adequate health facilities for basic care are available in Bujumbura, but health care throughout the country is below U.S. standards. Public medical clinics often lack basic resources and supplies. Hospitals and doctors often require cash payment up front, prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not available. Medical staff may speak little or no English. In general, minimal staffing is available overnight in non-emergency hospital wards. Consider having family spend the night with patients, especially a minor child. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities. Pharmaceuticals Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over-the-counter and those requiring prescriptions in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, expelled, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe and result in long jail sentences and heavy fines. If stopped by the police, you are expected to produce an acceptable form of identification. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Power Outages: Power outages occur frequently and may affect public services such as access to potable water.

Cabo Verde,"Exercise extreme caution when participating in water sports, such as swimming, boating, and fishing, as the tides and currents around the islands are very strong. Several small fishing boats have been lost at sea, and drownings have occurred on the beaches and along the coast in Santiago, Sal, and on other islands. The entire island of Fogo is an active volcano. Future eruptions remain a threat, as do earth tremors throughout the islands, especially on Fogo, Brava, and Santo Antão, and beneath the ocean channels that separate them. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available on our website . Crime :  Petty crime and burglary are common in Cabo Verde, especially at marketplaces, festivals, street fairs, and public gatherings. Criminals target anyone perceived to be affluent, regardless of nationality. Avoid groups of children who appear to have no adult supervision, since the perpetrators of petty theft and pickpocketing are often groups of street children. Muggings occur often, particularly at night and in more isolated areas, and often involve violence. The perpetrators are predominantly males between the ages of 14 and 25 operating in groups of two or more. Due to inadequate lighting in many public areas, you should be especially vigilant after dark, carry a flashlight to illuminate your path, and never go out alone. You should also keep vehicle doors and windows locked and avoid isolated places. It is dangerous to use hillside stairways connecting neighborhoods in Praia and many other Cabo Verdean cities and towns, even in broad daylight. These stairways isolate users and make them vulnerable to assault. International Financial Scams :  See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.

Cambodia,"The Department of State is concerned that individuals and groups may be planning terrorist actions against U.S. citizens and interests, including at sites frequented by Westerners in Southeast Asia. Extremist groups in Southeast Asia have transnational capabilities to carry out attacks against locations where Westerners congregate. Although the extremist threat in Cambodia is considered low and terrorist attacks are not common, U.S. citizens residing in, or traveling to, Cambodia should exercise caution in clubs, discos, bars, restaurants, hotels, places of worship, schools, outdoor recreation venues, tourist areas, beach resorts, and other places frequented by foreigners. U.S. citizens should remain vigilant with regard to their personal security and avoid ongoing police enforcement actions, crowds, and demonstrations. See Department of State’s Worldwide Caution . Land mines and unexploded ordnance are found in remote rural areas throughout Cambodia, and especially in Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Kampong Thom, and Oddar Meanchey provinces. Travelers in these regions should never walk in forested areas or even in dry rice paddies without a local guide. Areas around small bridges on secondary roads are particularly dangerous. Travelers should not touch anything that resembles a mine or unexploded ordnance; they should notify the Cambodia Mine Action Center at 012-800-473/023-995-437. Crime: Cambodia has a critical crime rate, including street crime. Military weapons and explosives are readily available to criminals despite authorities’ efforts to collect and destroy such weapons. Armed robberies occur frequently, and foreign residents and visitors, including U.S. citizens, are among the victims. The Embassy has also received reports that residences and hotel rooms of U.S. citizens in Phnom Penh were burglarized while the occupants were asleep. The most common type of theft is “snatch and grab” robbery, and anything that can be quickly grabbed is at risk: cameras, jewelry, purses, backpacks, mobile phones, etc. Exercise caution and keep belongings out of sight if you travel via “tuk-tuk,” as passengers in these open-air vehicles have been targeted by thieves. If walking along the street, make yourself less of a target by carrying bags or items in your hand or on the shoulder that is furthest from the street. If someone attempts to rob you, you should surrender your valuables immediately, since any perceived resistance may be met with physical violence, including lethal force. The U.S. Embassy has received reports of violent robberies escalating into fatalities. Pickpockets, some who are masquerading as beggars, are present in the markets and at the tourist sites. Sometimes they may act overly friendly, placing their hand on your shoulder or back to distract you in order to pick your pocket. To avoid the risk of theft or confiscation of original documents, the U.S. Embassy advises its personnel and all U.S. citizens traveling to, or residing in, Cambodia to carry photocopies of their U.S. passport, driver's license, and other important documents and to leave the originals in a hotel safe or other secure place. The U.S. Embassy advises citizens not to give their passport as collateral for motorcycle rentals, hotels, etc. Local police rarely investigate reports of crime against tourists, and travelers should not expect to recover stolen items. It has also been reported that some police stations charge foreigners between $20 and $100 to file a police report. Foreigners travelling to Cambodia should be aware of common scams targeting tourists, often involving card games. [MWP(P1] The Embassy has received reports of U.S. citizens being approached by individuals in public locations, such as popular shopping malls, and being invited to their homes where they end up participating in card games. These are often scams to steal tourists’ money. If you find yourself a victim of one of these scams, you should contact the U.S. Embassy. Foreigners travelling to Cambodia should be aware of crime targeting tourists involving drugged drinks. The Embassy has received reports of U.S. citizens’ drinks being drugged at bars in order to incapacitate them for theft or sexual assault. Do not accept drinks from strangers and do not leave drinks unattended. The U.S. Embassy advises citizens to be wary of scams involving individuals claiming they are in Cambodia and need financial assistance from the United States. The Embassy has determined that many of these requests are fraudulent and the individuals making the requests use false identities. In the past year, numerous confirmed media reports of large-scale scam operations have led to a crackdown by Cambodian authorities. These operations have been reported to lure non-Cambodians with false promises of gainful employment. Victims of this false recruitment have then been made to participate in the online/phone-based financial confidence scams. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. There have been numerous reports of visitors receiving fake or novelty $50 and $100 bills from ATM machines and banks across Cambodia. When receiving money from ATMs or bank tellers, you should count and examine the money while still in the presence of the ATM camera or bank teller. The fake money typically has a different feel than real U.S. currency and often has markings on the lower left that indicate it is for novelty purposes. If a suspicious bill is discovered, it should be shown to the ATM camera or teller, and the bank should be notified immediately. The U.S. Embassy advises its personnel who travel to the provinces outside of Phnom Penh to exercise caution outside the provincial towns at all times. Many rural parts of the country remain without effective policing. Avoid walking alone after dusk anywhere in Sihanoukville, especially along the waterfront. You should be particularly vigilant during annual festivals and at tourist sites in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville, where there have been marked increases in motorcycle “snatch and grab” thefts of bags and purses. If you are visiting Cambodia, you should practice sound personal security awareness by varying your routes and routines, maintaining a low profile, not carrying or displaying large amounts of cash, not wearing flashy or expensive jewelry, and not walking alone after dark. In addition, you should travel by automobile and not use local moto-taxis or cyclos (passenger-carrying bicycles). These vehicles are more vulnerable to armed robberies and offer no protection against injury when involved in traffic accidents. U.S. citizens are advised not to engage in commercial surrogacy arrangements in Cambodia. In October 2016, the Government of Cambodia issued an official proclamation banning commercial surrogacy in Cambodia. Please keep in mind that U.S. citizens and other foreigners in Cambodia are subject to Cambodian laws and procedures. Although gambling and casinos are legal in Cambodia, the U.S. Embassy strongly encourages all travelers to be cautious in choosing to visit casinos or related gambling centers in Cambodia. The U.S. Embassy is aware of numerous reported incidents at casinos throughout Cambodia. In the past year, these incidents such as fires at casinos resulting in multiple fatalities, violent assaults, murders, and suicides under suspicious circumstances have occurred.

U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","Medical facilities and services in Cambodia do not meet international standards. Both Phnom Penh and Siem Reap have a limited number of internationally run clinics and hospitals that can provide basic medical care and stabilization. Medical care outside of these two cities is almost non-existent. Local pharmacies provide a limited supply of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Because the quality of locally obtained medications can vary greatly, make sure to bring a supply of your medications adequate for the duration of your stay in Cambodia. You should be wary of purchasing local medication. Counterfeit medication is readily available, often indiscernible from authentic medication, and potentially lethal.

If you break local laws in Cambodia, your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution. The same rights and protections afforded those accused of a crime in the U.S. are not guaranteed in Cambodia, and the judicial process may be influenced by political, personal, and financial connections. In both the criminal and civil judicial systems, resources devoted to the investigation/discovery and trial process fall far below the standard expected in the United States. Cambodia routinely employs pre-trial detention for those charged with criminal offenses, sometimes for long periods of time before a trial is scheduled. Prison conditions in Cambodia are substandard and overcrowded, with little access to health care or basic nutritional requirements. U.S. citizens in Cambodia should be aware that there are limits to the assistance the Embassy can offer to those with concerns about due process or the fairness of their trial, as the Embassy is unable to interfere in the legal processes of a host country. You can be prosecuted in the United States for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under that country’s laws.

Public displays of affection are generally frowned upon for couples of any sexual orientation. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section six of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: While in Cambodia, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what they find in the United States. Currently, except for buildings and hotels that have been built under international standards, most public places and public transportation are not accessible. Persons with disabilities will face difficulties with Cambodia’s sidewalks, rest rooms, road crossings, and tourist areas. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: There have been reports of sexual assaults in the vicinity of drinking establishments and possible drugs being used to incapacitate female travelers. See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Water Festival: During this annual festival, which takes place in November, the population in Phnom Penh increases significantly as millions of Cambodians from every town and province flock to the capital for three days. For personal safety and security, you should avoid crowded areas near the riverfront during the Water Festival holiday. Customs: Cambodian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Cambodia of items such as medications, firearms, antiquities, or ivory. It is advisable to contact the Embassy of Cambodia in Washington D.C. for specific information regarding customs requirements. Restrictions on Freedom of Expression and Association: There are freedom of speech restrictions in Cambodia. Anyone who criticizes or insults the King by any means could face between one to five years in prison. This ban includes insults or criticism made online and via social media. The government of Cambodia has used libel and slander laws to restrict public discussion on topics it deems sensitive or against its interests. Dual Nationality: Dual nationality is allowed under Cambodia's 1996 nationality law. However, if you have Cambodian nationality and possess another nationality, you may be viewed as a Cambodian citizen in any court proceedings and face stricter sentences. Business Transactions: Some U.S. citizens have reported threats of personal injury, extortion, detention, or kidnapping related to personal business disputes, in particular those involving real estate. If you are planning to engage in real estate or other significant financial transactions, please proceed with caution and retain the appropriate legal counsel. Financial Transaction: The U.S. dollar is widely used, especially for larger transactions, and most prices are quoted in dollars. Ripped, torn, or stained U.S. bills are not accepted. Authorities encourage greater use of the Cambodian riel, but it is less favored and is mostly given to tourists as change for dollar purchases. The riel is commonly used in smaller towns and rural areas. Credit cards are accepted at some establishments within Cambodia, and a number of banks in Phnom Penh accept credit cards for cash advances. Credit cards are often subject to a service charge. Banks and major hotels accept travelers' checks but usually charge a service fee. Several international banks operate ATM machines that allow travelers to obtain U.S. dollar currency in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and other urban centers. Personal checks are not generally accepted. Several banks serve as Western Union agents, to which funds can be wired, including in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Sihanoukville, and other provincial cities. Information on Western Union can be found at their website . Photography: Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest — including government buildings, military installations, airfields, and bridges — may result in problems with the authorities and confiscation of your camera."
Cameroon,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa are active in Far North, North, and Adamawa Regions of Cameroon. Suicide bombings have occurred in public places in and around urban areas resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Terrorist attacks are most common outside major towns, especially in the regions bordering Nigeria and Chad . Extremists have frequently target areas of congregation, particularly camps for refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). While most victims of terrorist attacks in Cameroon have been locals, violent extremist organizations may seek to target Westerners or conduct other high-profile operations. Kidnapping by terrorist organizations remains a concern. Refrain from traveling outside of cities or towns after dark and exercise caution when in the vicinity of potential targets. There is ongoing violence in Northwest and Southwest Cameroon. Security force operations and attacks by armed militants regularly take place throughout these Regions including in major cities. Neighboring areas of other regions are at risk of spillover violence, including Douala. Use of improvised explosives and incendiary devices, kidnappings, illegitimate detentions, and acts of violent criminality by armed actors have also occurred in Northwest and Southwest Cameroon. Security forces, government officials, road travelers, administrative buildings, schools, and commercial areas have been repeatedly attacked. Those suspected of being associated, even tangentially, with the central government or armed militants have been targeted for reprisals by a variety of elements. Border Areas : Cameroon’s borders remain porous. Terrorists regularly cross the border into Cameroon from Nigeria and Chad to conduct attacks in the Far North, North, and Adamawa Regions. Militant activities and security operations routinely occur along Cameroon’s shared border with Nigeria in the Northwest and Southwest Regions. Armed criminals and communal militia frequently conduct attacks in border areas abutting the Central African Republic (CAR). Embassy personnel are restricted from traveling to the Northwest, Southwest, North, and Far North Regions of Cameroon, as well as within 20 kilometers of the border with the Central African Republic in Adamawa and East Regions, and within 20 kilometers of the border with Nigeria and north of Ngaoudere in the Adamawa Region. Bakassi Peninsula: Cameroon's military authorities restrict access to the Bakassi Peninsula. U.S. citizens should avoid this area. Use of Improvised Explosive Devices : Multiple improvised explosive device (IED) attacks have occurred in Douala and Yaoundé since June 2020. The threat for similar attacks could take place countrywide. Various armed actors, to include terrorists and political militants, may use such devices. To date, recent IED incidents have not directly targeted U.S. citizens or areas frequented by Westerners, however the risk of wrong place/wrong time violence remains. Locations with a high security force or government presence may be at increased risk of being targeted. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Violent and opportunistic crime is prevalent throughout the country including major cities. Foreigners in Cameroon have been victims of all types of crime including murder, sexual assault, kidnapping, carjacking, burglary, theft, armed robbery, and home invasion. Criminals often employ violence, particularly in instances where victims attempt to resist. The risk of street and residential crime is especially high, even in affluent areas with a large police and private security presence. Transport Crimes: U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from using taxis. Violent assaults on taxi passengers are common. Petty theft is prevalent, particularly on trains, buses, and taxis. The Hilton and Mont Febe hotels offer a shuttle service from Yaoundé-Nsimalen Airport to downtown Yaoundé. Travelers are encouraged to use this service or retain the services of a reputable private transport company. Avoid walking alone especially after dark. Do not display cash and valuables. Drive with doors locked and windows closed. Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Maritime Security : Piracy and armed robbery continue to increase throughout the Gulf of Guinea including Cameroon’s waters. Pirates and armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property are common and may occur near coastal areas or deep waters. More information on current conditions may be found on the Office of Naval Intelligence’s piracy page. Communications: During periods of heightened unrest or insecurity, there is a heightened risk of communications disruptions which may affect internet access, social media, mobile messaging, and cellular voice calls. These disruptions may be localized or countrywide. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Cameroon. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/online dating Financial transactions/money transfers Too good to be true purchases or sales Contracts with promises of large commissions Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police by calling 117 and contact the U.S. Embassy at + (237) 22220-1500. Dial + (237) 22222-2525 in Yaoundé or dial 112 in major cities to contact ambulance services. If you have been a victim of sexual assault or rape, consider contacting a medical provider for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis.

Victims of Crime: Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in Douala and Yaoundé. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of these two cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","For emergency services in Cameroon, dial the number of the hospital in the area where you are located. There is currently no national number for general health-related emergencies in the country. Ambulance services are: Not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Yaoundé and Douala. Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.

Public medical clinics may lack basic resources and supplies. Hospitals and doctors may require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment. Medical staff may communicate primarily in French and speak little or no English. Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse if the hospital is amenable or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on Medical Tourism. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Cameroon. Although Cameroon has elective/cosmetic surgery facilities, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Cameroon, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available, and professionals are accredited and qualified. Persons traveling to Cameroon for medical purposes require the proper “medical” visa. Check the Government of Cameroon’s website for more information. Pharmaceuticals Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Cameroon may not allow the importation of some medication. Travelers should avoid carrying any prohibited medication. Please review Cameroon rules on medication or contact the Ministry of Health's Directorate of Pharmacies and Medications . Non-Traditional Medicine U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners overseas. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities in such cases. Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy If you are considering traveling to Cameroon to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our ART and Surrogacy Abroad page .

Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Armed Conflict : There are ongoing military operations throughout CAR; armed groups remain active in large parts of the country. Outside Bangui, criminals and various armed actors frequently perpetrate violence against civilians to include foreigners and humanitarian workers; road travelers and those operating outside Bangui are especially vulnerable. Armed robberies, physical and sexual assaults, ambushes, homicides, illicit taxation and extortion, arbitrary search and seizures, unlawful detentions, and kidnappings of civilians are common. Armed actors in northwestern CAR have increasingly used landmines and other explosive devices along roads and in areas near the Cameroonian border. Outbreaks of intercommunal violence and armed conflict can happen without warning anywhere in the country including Bangui.

Sinopharm and Sinovac have received approval for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO). Please contact your local health authorities for more information. Visit the FDA's website to learn more about FDA-approved vaccines in the United States. Quality of Care: The standards of medical care in the PRC are not equivalent to those in the United States. Even in private hospitals or public hospitals with well-equipped wards, English-speaking patients frequently encounter difficulty due to cultural, language, and regulatory differences. Rural areas have rudimentary facilities and inadequate staffing. Additionally, Rh-negative blood may be difficult to obtain; the blood type of the general Asian populace is Rh positive. Payment and Insurance: Ambulances in the PRC are often slow to arrive, and most do not have sophisticated medical equipment or trained responders. Cash payment for services is often required prior to treatment, including emergency cases. Travelers will be asked to post a deposit prior to admission to cover the expected cost of treatment. Hospitals in major cities may accept credit cards. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General in the PRC maintain lists of local English-speaking doctors and hospitals . Use of Medicare/Medicaid in the PRC: Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Hospitals and doctors in the PRC often do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Medication: If traveling with prescription medication, check with the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the United States of America to ensure the medication is legal in the PRC. Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with the prescription. Many commonly used U.S. drugs and medications are not available in the PRC, and counterfeit, low-quality knockoffs are prevalent. If you try to have medications sent to you from outside the PRC, you may have problems getting them released by PRC Customs authorities and/or you may have to pay high customs duties. Air Quality: Air pollution is a significant problem in many locations. Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. The PRC’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment also provides its own air quality data for cities throughout the PRC. Most roads and towns in Tibet, Qinghai, parts of Xinjiang, and western Sichuan are situated at altitudes over 10,000 feet. Take appropriate precautions to prepare for and be alert to altitude sickness. Disease: The following diseases are prevalent: Influenza Typhoid Measles Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Tuberculosis Sexually transmitted infections (e.g., syphilis) Vaccinations: Be up to date on all routine vaccinations recommended by the CDC. The CDC traveler’s health site for the PRC provides vaccine recommendations specific to travel within the PRC. For further health information : World Health Organization (WHO) U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. See crimes against minors abroad and the U.S. Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General immediately. PRC authorities must notify a U.S. consular officer within four days; however, this does not always occur in a timely manner. A consular officer may be the only authorized visitor during your initial detention period. Bail is rarely granted. Detention may last many months before a trial. The U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General is unable to represent you in a legal matter. Travelers to the PRC should enroll in the State Department’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) and you may wish to have someone contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General if you are detained. Please see the section on DUAL NATIONALITY for the limits on consular notification and access to dual nationals. See U.S. Department of State’s webpage for further information. The PRC legal system can be opaque and the interpretation and enforcement of local laws arbitrary. The judiciary does not enjoy independence from political influence. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in the PRC should be aware of varying levels of scrutiny to which they will be subject from local law enforcement and state security. Certain provisions of the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China, such as “social order” crimes (Article 293) and crimes involving “endangering state security” and “state secrets” (Article 102 to 113), are ill-defined and can be interpreted by the authorities arbitrarily and situationally. Information that may be common knowledge in other countries could be considered a “state secret” in the PRC, and information can be designated a “state secret” retroactively. Drug and Alcohol Enforcement: PRC law-enforcement authorities have little tolerance for illegal drugs, including marijuana. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs in the PRC are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences, heavy fines, or the death penalty. Police regularly conduct unannounced drug tests on people suspected of drug use and have been known to enter a bar or nightclub and subject all patrons to immediate drug testing. Police may force you to provide a urine, blood, or hair follicle sample on short notice. A positive finding, even if the drug was legal elsewhere or consumed prior to arriving in the PRC, can lead to immediate detention, fines, deportation, and/or a ban from re-entering the PRC. The PRC also has strict laws against driving under the influence of alcohol that can lead to immediate detention on a criminal charge. Assisted Reproductive Technology: In vitro fertilization (IVF) is widely and legally practiced. PRC law, however, strictly forbids surrogacy, and surrogacy contracts will not be considered valid. The use of reproductive technology for medical research and profit is strictly controlled. Contracts and Commercial Disputes: Before entering into a commercial or employment contract in the PRC, have it reviewed by legal counsel both in the United States and in the PRC. The U.S. International Trade Administration can assist you in identifying and vetting business contacts and opportunities but may not intervene in contract disputes. Many U.S. citizens have reported difficulty getting their contracts enforced by PRC courts or being forced out of profitable joint-ventures without opportunity to secure legal recourse in the PRC. Counterfeit Goods: Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods. Bootlegs are illegal in the United States, and you may also be breaking local law by purchasing them. Cruise Ship Passengers: Click here for safety information and travel advice . Digital Payments: The PRC has transitioned to almost a predominantly cashless society. Some mobile phone applications offer a digital payment solution for individuals visiting the PRC on a temporary or long-term basis. Often, payment is made through an individual using their mobile phone to scan a vendor or business’s QR code. The number of locations accepting foreign credit cards has decreased in recent years. Visitors to the PRC should research whether the locations they are visiting will accept foreign credit cards and familiarize themselves with mobile digital payment options prior to traveling to the PRC. Earthquakes: Earthquakes occur throughout the PRC. Check here for information about preparing for a crisis or disaster overseas. English/Secondary School Teachers: English teachers in the PRC frequently report employment disputes which can result in questioning by local authorities, termination, lost wages, confiscation of passports, forced eviction from housing, and even threats of violence. Exit Bans: Business disputes, court orders to pay a settlement, or government investigations into both criminal and civil issues may result in an exit ban which will prohibit your departure from the PRC until the issue is resolved. Even individuals and their family members who are not directly involved, or even aware of these proceedings, can be subject to an exit ban. Additionally, some local businesspeople who feel that they have been wronged by a foreign business partner may hire ""debt collectors” to harass, intimidate, and sometimes physically detain foreign business partners or family members in hopes of collecting the debt. The U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General can provide a list of local attorneys who serve U.S. clients but are otherwise unable to intervene in civil cases. Local law enforcement authorities are generally unwilling to become involved in what they consider private business matters and may not provide the individual who has been barred from leaving the PRC with any written notice of the exit ban. Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Reports Country Reports on Human Rights Practices Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: Same sex marriages are not legally recognized in the PRC and local authorities will not provide marriage certificates to same-sex couples. There are no civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination or harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity, though homosexuality has been decriminalized. Prejudices and discrimination still exist in many parts of the country. There are growing LGBTQI+ communities in some of the largest cities in the PRC and violence against LGBTQI+ individuals in the PRC is relatively rare. See Section 6 of our Human Rights Practices in the Human Rights Report for the People's Republic of China and read our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page . Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): In January 2017, the PRC implemented a law regulating the operations of foreign NGOs in the PRC. NGOs and their employees should ensure they are complying with all relevant statutory requirements, particularly if working in sensitive areas or fields. Additionally, the PRC government announced sanctions on five U.S.-based NGOs in December 2019. North Korea: Do not travel to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) due to the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention of U.S. nationals. For further information, consult the North Korea International Travel Information page and the North Korea Travel Advisory . Political and Religious Activity: Participating in unauthorized political or religious activities, including participating in public protests or sending private electronic messages critical of the government may result in detention and PRC government-imposed restrictions on future travel to the PRC. Although the PRC constitution permits freedom of religious belief, it does not permit freedom of religious practice and government officials are increasing pressure on domestic religious activities. The U.S. Mission to the PRC has observed an increase in the number of U.S. citizens being interrogated, detained, and/or forced to leave the country in connection with real or perceived religious proselytization. U.S. citizens have been detained and/or expelled for distributing religious literature, including Bibles, or engaging in unauthorized religious meetings. If you bring religious literature with you, local law dictates that it be a “reasonable amount” for your personal use. If you attempt to bring larger quantities, the literature will likely be confiscated and you may be fined, detained, or deported. Social Insurance: The PRC has a social insurance system to which foreigners who work in the PRC must contribute. When you sign an employment contract, you must apply for a social insurance number, and it is important that your employer work with you to comply with the regulations. Please check the official website for updated information. Social Media: Social media accounts are widely monitored in the PRC. Local authorities may use information they deem critical, controversial, or that might involve illegal activity against both the poster of the material and the host of the social media forum under local law. Individuals have also been held responsible for the content that others place within social media spaces they control, such as the comments section under a post or within a group chat that an individual controls. Special Scrutiny of Foreign Citizens: On occasion, U.S. citizens visiting or resident in the PRC have been interrogated or detained for reasons said to be related to “state security.” In such circumstances, you could face arrest, detention, or an exit ban prohibiting your departure from the PRC for a prolonged period. Dual U.S.-PRC nationals and U.S. citizens of Chinese heritage may be at a higher risk of facing such special scrutiny. Information about dual nationality can be found on our website. Students: See our U.S. Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Surveillance and Monitoring: Security personnel carefully watch foreign visitors and may place you under surveillance. Hotel rooms (including meeting rooms), offices, cars, taxis, telephones, internet usage, ​digital payments, and fax machines may be monitored onsite or remotely, and personal possessions in hotel rooms, including computers, may be searched without your consent or knowledge. Security personnel have been known to detain and deport U.S. citizens sending private electronic messages critical of the PRC government. Transferring Money to/from the PRC: The regulatory environment in the PRC includes tightening capital outflow controls that can severely impact one’s ability to move money out of the country. Wire transfers may only be available to those who have an active bank account in the PRC. Ask your local bank location in the PRC for more information. The U.S. Department of State may be able to help transfer funds to a destitute U.S citizen overseas through our office in Washington, D.C., to a U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General abroad. More information on this option is available here . Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: U.S. citizens with mobility disabilities may face challenges while traveling in the PRC. Sidewalks often do not have curb cuts and many streets can be crossed only via pedestrian bridges or underpasses accessible by staircase. Assistive technologies for blind people and those with other vision disabilities are unreliable, and access to elevators in public buildings can be restricted. In major cities, public restrooms in places visited by tourists usually have a least one accessible toilet. See Persons with Disabilities in the Human Rights Report for the People's Republic of China (2022) . Typhoons: The southeast coast of the PRC is subject to strong typhoons and tropical storms, usually from July through September. For current information, please consult the Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Honolulu and the National Weather Service's Central Pacific Hurricane Center . Women Travelers: If you are a woman traveling abroad, please review our travel tips for Women Travelers . Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region: Extraordinary security measures are in place through the region. Authorities may impose curfews and restrictions on short notice. They may also engage in invasive surveillance techniques against individuals. Expect significant travel delays, avoid gatherings and demonstrations, always carry ID, and follow the instructions of local authorities. Travelers with ethnic ties to the region may experience special restrictions, discrimination, and even arbitrary detention."
Colombia,"Terrorism : Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting events, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Terrorist groups and criminal organizations continue operating and carrying out attacks in Colombia. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime : Crimes and scams against tourists, and those perceived to be wealthy, are common and well-coordinated in urban areas, including in affluent neighborhoods. Firearms and knives are prevalent in Colombia and often used in muggings and robberies under the threat of violence. Drive-by motorcyclist snatchings of cell phones, bags, and valuables are extremely common. Victims are often identified well in advance of the robbery based on visible jewelry, high value wristwatches, and general attire while in public places such as shopping malls, restaurants, and airports. Narco-trafficking groups, including the Clan del Golfo frequently engage in violence against civilians and security forces. Dating App Robberies/Drugging/Homicides: Criminals use dating apps to lure victims to meet in places such as hotels, restaurants, and bars, and then later assault and rob them. Numerous U.S. citizens in Colombia have been drugged, robbed, and even killed by their Colombian dates. You should be cautious if using dating apps in Colombia. If meeting with a stranger, you should strongly consider meeting only in public places and avoiding isolated locations, such as residences or hotel rooms, where crimes are most likely to occur. Tell a friend or family member of your plans, including where you are going, details of the person you are meeting, and the app you used to meet them. ATMs : There have been instances of fraudulent charges or withdrawals from accounts due to “skimmed” cards. If you choose to use credit or debit cards, you should regularly check your account to ensure there are no unauthorized transactions. Travelers should limit the amount of cash they carry in public, exercise caution when withdrawing cash from ATMs, and avoid ATMs located on the street. ATMs inside shopping malls or other protected locations are preferable. Taxis : U.S. government employees are prohibited from hailing taxis on the street due to the risk of assault or robbery. U.S. citizens have been killed during robberies while using taxis. Use a dispatch service or cell phone app whenever possible. Disabling Drugs : The Embassy receives regular reports of criminals using drugs to temporarily incapacitate unsuspecting victims and then rob or assault them. Scopolamine, a fast-acting incapacitating drug, is often surreptitiously applied to food, drinks, and hand sanitizer vials by criminals to rob or assault their victims. Victims of scopolamine-related crimes are often targeted in bars, night clubs, or through dating apps. Avoid leaving food or drinks unattended at a bar or restaurant, and refuse offers of something to eat or drink from a stranger. Ayahuasca/Hallucinogens: Traditional hallucinogens, often referred to as ayahuasca, can be marketed to tourists as “spiritual cleansing,” and typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong psychedelic that is illegal in the United States and many other countries. Risks to hallucinogen users while intoxicated include robbery, assault, illness, or death. People claiming to be shamans or spiritual practitioners are neither licensed nor regulated. Demonstrations : Protests and demonstrations occur frequently, particularly in Bogota. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams : See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Colombia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Posing as U.S. government officials soliciting payment for services. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police by dialing 123 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +57 (601) 275-2000 or +57 (601) 275-4021 after hours. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Help you find appropriate medical care. Assist you in reporting a crime to the police. Contact relatives or friends with your written consent. Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion. Provide a list of local attorneys. Provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution. Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home. Replace a stolen or lost passport. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Help in domestic violence situations is available, in Spanish, by calling 155 (*155 from a cell phone). Tourism : The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are uncommon. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified by the government or by recognized authorities. In the event of an injury, adequate medical treatment may only be available in or near major cities. First responders may only be able to provide basic medical treatment and may be unable to access areas outside of major cities. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance . Venezuelan Border : The U.S. Department of State has categorized Venezuela as Level 4: Do Not Travel due to crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, kidnapping, and the arrest and detention of U.S. citizens without due process or fair trial guarantees. U.S. citizens are at risk of detention when crossing into Venezuela from Colombia. The Colombia-Venezuela border is not clearly marked, and U.S. citizens should not go near the border due to the risk of crossing into Venezuela accidentally and being detained for illegal entry. If you still choose to travel to Venezuela, do not attempt to enter Venezuela without a visa. Visas are not available upon arrival. U.S. citizens attempting to enter Venezuela without a visa have been charged with terrorism and other serious crimes and detained for long periods. The Maduro regime does not notify the U.S. government of the detention of U.S. citizens and the U.S. government is not granted access to those citizens. The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Venezuela.","For emergency services in Colombia, dial 123 from any mobile phone or land line. Ambulance services are available in larger cities, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. We do not pay medical bills .  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance : Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Travelers can check with the Embassy of Colombia in the United States to ensure the medication is legal in Colombia. Vaccinations :  Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Visit the CDC Traveler View website for vaccination information, and the Colombia Ministry of Health website for Yellow Fever vaccination requirements. Childhood vaccinations are required by Colombian law for children ages six and under.  Visit the Ministry for Health and Public Safety website for a list of required childhood vaccinations. Further Health Information : World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Air Quality : Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals .  We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Health Facilities in General : Adequate health facilities are available throughout the country, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Hospitals and doctors often require payment upfront prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is frequently, but not always, available. Medical staff may speak little or no English. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery : U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery. Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on Medical Tourism. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for information on medical tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Colombia. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications or repatriation in the case of untimely death. Your legal options in cases of malpractice are very limited in Colombia. Although Colombia has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Colombia, carefully research the doctor and recovery facility you plan to use. Make sure that emergency medical facilities are available, and that professionals are accredited and qualified. Share all health information (e.g. medical conditions, medications, allergies) with your doctor before surgery. Pharmaceuticals : Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas.  Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients.  Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Colombia does not allow the sale of certain psychiatric medications.  Travelers should carry a sufficient supply for their trips. Please review the Colombian government’s open data website for drug unavailability. Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy : If you are considering traveling to Colombia to have a child through the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our ART and Surrogacy Abroad page . Surrogacy is currently neither prohibited nor permitted under Colombian law. Although surrogacy agencies/clinics claim surrogacy is legal in Colombia, there is no legal framework for foreigners or same-sex couples to pursue surrogacy. As a result, surrogacy agreements between foreign or same sex intending parents and gestational mothers may not be enforced by Colombian courts. Water Quality : In rural areas, tap water may not be potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Altitude : Many cities in Colombia, such as Bogota, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Travel to High Altitudes . Adventure Travel : Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel . General Health : The following diseases are prevalent: COVID-19 Dengue Chikungunya Malaria Yellow Fever Zika In Chocó, Nariño, and Córdoba, use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents, and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers in the Amazon region, even for short stays. HIV/AIDS: Travelers should bring medication sufficient for their entire stay. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in Colombia. Air Quality : Air pollution is a problem in several major cities in Colombia. Consider the impact smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens People over 65 years of age People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema People with heart disease or diabetes People who work or are active outdoors","Criminal Penalties : You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned, or expelled. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. Customs Regulations : If you enter or exit Colombia possessing cash or other financial instruments worth more than $10,000USD, you must declare them and be able to prove the legal source of the funds. The Embassy has received reports of customs officials confiscating high-value jewelry that was not declared upon entry. Colombian law prohibits tourists and business travelers from bringing firearms and ammunition into Colombia. Colombian law also restricts the importation of plants and animals (and some related products). Artifacts : Colombian law forbids the export of pre-Columbian objects and other artifacts protected by cultural patrimony statutes. U.S. customs officials are obliged to seize pre-Columbian objects and certain colonial religious artwork brought into the United States. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Colombia are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long pre-trial detention and lengthy prison sentences under harsh conditions. Colombian law may require that released offenders serve a lengthy period of parole in-country, during which the offender is given no housing and may lack permission to work. Colombia uses comprehensive screening procedures to detect narcotics smuggling at its international airports. Travelers are occasionally questioned, searched, fingerprinted, and/or asked to submit to an abdominal X-ray upon arrival or departure. Most airport inspectors do not speak English. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods : Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Faith-Based Travelers : See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers : Colombia has one of the strongest legal frameworks in Latin America defending the rights of LGBTQI+ people; however, in practice protections remain a long way from full enforcement and harassment persists, especially in rural areas. In many parts of Colombia, violence against trans people exceeds levels of violence against any other members of the LGBTQI+ community. Criminals do utilize dating apps to target potential victims of theft, so travelers should use caution on such apps. Certain regions, especially in rural areas, experience higher instances of harassment/violence against LGBTQI+ communities. In 2022, there was an uptick of homicides specifically targeting gay men in Medellín. LGBTQI+ associated and friendly establishments exist mostly in metropolitan areas, especially Cartagena, Medellin, and Bogota. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities : The law in Colombia prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities, but the law is not fully enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities is not as prevalent as in the United States. Many public places and transportation are not adapted to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities. The most common types of accessible facilities may include restrooms, ramps, and elevators. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure, including sidewalks, intersections, buses, and taxis. There is a significant difference between the capital (and other large cities) and the rest of the country. Repair and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices are available. Sign language interpreters or personal assistants are available for hire. Students : See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers : See our travel tips for Women Travelers .

The U.S. Embassy in Madagascar provides consular assistance; there is no full-time official U.S. presence in Comoros. Clothing: Comorians dress conservatively. Shorts or short sleeves should be avoided, except at the beach. Phone Service: Cellular phones are the norm, as other telephone service is unreliable and landlines are nearly non-existent. It may be possible to purchase a SIM card locally and use a GSM-compatible cell phone. Cellular data packages, at 2G or 3G speeds, are also available for purchase. Currency: The Comorian Franc (KMF) is the official currency. This is a cash society; credit cards are not widely accepted. There are three banks on the island to exchange currency. Utilities Outages: The supply of electricity is frequently disrupted, sometimes for extended periods. Water supplies can fluctuate (including potable water), affecting tourist and other public services. Faith-Based Travelers: Reports of religious-based violence are rare. Proselytizing or the public practice of non-Sunni Muslim religious ceremonies is against the law in the Comoros.

The government enforces the laws on rape with some effectiveness if survivors pursue charges. See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Costa Rica,"Crime: In areas frequented by tourists, including national parks, theft and pickpocketing are the most common crimes targeting United States citizen travelers. More violent crimes, including sexual assault and murders, have occurred. Armed assailants usually target victims for their smartphones, wallets, or purses. If confronted by someone with a weapon, it is best not to resist. Do not leave valuables unattended on the beach, in an unattended vehicle, or in an unlocked room. Even a locked vehicle in an area with parking attendants may be broken into. Avoid isolated areas when on foot, especially after dark. Maintain situational awareness and secure your valuables out of sight. The Embassy is aware of reports of robbery of isolated rental properties. Research any rental homes to ensure they have adequate security and remember to properly secure all doors and windows. See the Costa Rica Country Security Report (osac.gov) for an overview of crime in Costa Rica. For information about international financial scams, see the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: United States citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the United States Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the United States Embassy at +506 2519-2000 or acssanjose@state.gov. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. Authorities will only investigate and prosecute a crime if the victim files a police report (denuncia). The Costa Rican Investigative Police (OIJ) is responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes that occur in Costa Rica. To file a police report : Visit the local office of the OIJ. You can find the closest location by calling 800-800-3000. The Tourist Police can also take reports at the following tourist destinations: Tamarindo Flamingo Puerto Viejo Guiones Dominical El Coco See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .

Check with airlines regarding their rebooking policies. Beach Safety : Swimming areas at some popular beaches around Costa Rica can have dangerous rip currents. Some beaches lack lifeguards or warnings of unsafe conditions. United States citizens have died in Costa Rica due to these dangers. Check the Costa Rica Tourism Institute (ICT) website, or with your hotel or relevant tour operator to request current information on local swimming and surf conditions. You can read more about staying safe on Costa Rican beaches in this ICT pamphlet, which is in English and Spanish . Please be aware that the Costa Rica Tourism Institute confirms that there are trained lifeguards at the following beaches: Pacific Coast: Manuel Antonio Beach Caldera Beach Esterillos Oeste Beach Bahia Ballena Beach Ventanas Beach Tamarindo Beach Caribbean Coast: Cocles Beach Manzanillo Beach Negra Beach (Limon) The Oceanographic Information Module at the Center for Research in Marine Sciences of the University of Costa Rica provides public information regarding wind and wave forecasts, including warnings of hazardous conditions. You can learn more about the dangers of rip currents and how to avoid them from the NOAA National Weather Service's Rip Current webpage. Do not dive into water of unknown depth. Do not swim alone, especially at isolated beaches. Avoid the consumption of alcohol while swimming. Tourism : The Costa Rica Tourism Institute (ICT) website maintains a list of Certified Tour Guides . You can also find valuable tourism safety and security information for Costa Rica in these English and Spanish language pamphlets provided by ICT . Adventure Sports: Some tour operators take risks, and government regulation and oversight of firms that organize sporting activities may not always adhere to international standards and best practices. United States citizens have died in Costa Rica while participating in adventure sports. Use caution and common sense when engaging in ALL adventure sports, such as bungee jumping, sky diving, hiking, rappelling, climbing, whitewater rafting, kayaking, etc. Make sure your medical insurance covers your sport. See our section on Medical Insurance under “Health” below. The Ministry of Health maintains a list of authorized Adventure Sports operators. Never participate in adventure sports alone. Always carry identification and let others know where you are at all times. Before kayaking and rafting, check river conditions and wear a life jacket and helmet. Even popular rafting locations such as the Rio Naranjo near Quepos can become extremely dangerous in flash flood conditions. When hiking, rappelling, or climbing, carry a first aid kit and know the location of the nearest rescue center. Observe all local or park regulations and exercise caution in unfamiliar surroundings. Domestic Violence: United States citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Students and Volunteers: Violent assaults, rapes, and deaths have occurred involving students and volunteers. Ensure that your organization provides safety and security information on the area where you will stay. See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . To register complaints: Contact Costa Rica’s Tourism Commission or by phone at 800-TURISMO from Costa Rica or 011-506-2299-5800 from the United States. Email: contactenos@ict.go.cr Potential for Natural Disasters: Costa Rica is in an active earthquake and volcanic zone. Three volcanoes , two near San Jose and one in the northwest, have become more active in recent years. Ashfall due to volcanic eruptions from Turrialba can disrupt air traffic and cause or aggravate respiratory issues. Visitors should monitor and follow park service guidance and alerts regarding volcanic activity. Never attempt to climb or gain unauthorized access to an active volcano. Tsunamis may occur following significant earthquakes. Flooding occurs during the rainy season, typically from April until October, in the Caribbean Province of Limon and the Pacific Provinces of Puntarenas and Guanacaste. Flash floods and severe landslides occur in many parts of Costa Rica, depending on the time of year and rainfall. Do not drive into water of unknown depths. For information concerning disasters, see: U.S. Embassy Costa Rica website . The Embassy also sends out emergency information via e-mail, text, and/or Radio Dos (FM 99.5) or Radio Columbia (FM 98.7.) U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides general information about natural disaster preparedness Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides information regarding disease. U.S. Geological Survey provides updates on recent seismic and volcanic activity. Additional information regarding volcanic activity and other natural disasters in Costa Rica may be obtained from the following Spanish-language Costa Rican websites: Costa Rican National Emergency Commission Costa Rican Volcanic and Seismic Observatory Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Strikes may affect transportation, fuel supplies, and other public services. Local law prohibits foreigners from participating in public demonstrations, and violators may be subject to detention or deportation. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Hiking : When visiting national parks, abide by signage and stick to marked trails. First responders have limited ability to locate missing persons in remote areas. To hike in national parks, you must: Register with the park Obtain an entry permit Consider using a certified tour operator. The Costa Rican Tourist Institute (ICT) has contact information for Certified Tour Guides . Tourism : The tourism industry is generally regulated, and rules are regularly enforced. Inspections take place on a regular basis; however, some lapses may occur in businesses that are not properly registered. Hazardous areas or activities are not always identified with appropriate signage. Professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is available but may be delayed due to road and traffic conditions as well as physical distances. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. United States citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","For emergency services in Costa Rica, dial 911 . Ambulance services are widely available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below United States standards. Medical care in San Jose is generally adequate, but services can be limited in areas outside of San Jose. In remote areas, basic medical equipment may not be available. Ambulances may lack emergency equipment. Most prescription and over-the-counter medications are available; however, some United States citizens travel regularly to the United States to fill prescriptions that are unavailable locally. Bring a supply of your medications and carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that United States Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept United States health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on types of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Costa Rican immigration authorities reserve the right to prevent departure of those international travelers with unpaid or disputed medical bills. The United States Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals on our Embassy website . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Costa Rican Ministry of Health to ensure the medication is legal in Costa Rica. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Proof of yellow fever vaccination must be presented upon arrival for all passengers coming from certain countries in South America or Africa . Medical Tourism: Confirm that: Facilities and professionals will be able to provide an acceptable level of care Your insurance will cover any associated or emergency costs You understand the terms of payment and costs for treatment For clinics offering alternative medical treatments, thoroughly research these clinics and their providers. The Embassy has received reports of hospitalizations as a result of clients at so-called wellness centers undergoing medically unverified “alternative treatments.” We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. An air ambulance flight can cost $25,000 to $50,000 USD and will often take place only after payment has been received in full. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Air Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. Health facilities in general: Adequate health facilities are available throughout Costa Rica but health care in rural areas may be below United States standards. Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment. Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient. Medical staff may speak little or no English. Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery: United States citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery. Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Costa Rica. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Costa Rica. Although Costa Rica has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Costa Rica, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified. Pharmaceuticals: Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with few controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, be the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. United States Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Costa Rica does not allow the importation of most medications through the mail, even with a prescription. Travelers entering Costa Rica may carry personal medications with them and in suitcases, but also should carry a copy of the prescriptions. Medications should be in original packaging, and quantities should correspond to the prescription. Please review Costa Rica’s rules on importing medication at the Ministry of Health website . Alcohol: If you choose to drink alcohol, it is important to do so in moderation and to stop and seek medical attention if you begin to feel ill. There have been reports of individuals falling ill or dying after consuming alcohol tainted with methanol. Costa Rica’s Ministry of Health has advised any persons presenting health issues after consuming alcohol, such as severe vomiting, agitation, disorientation, blindness, or any other adverse reactions, to immediately call 911. Ministry of Health authorities are asking people to report any instances of the sale of unregulated alcohol or alcohol adulterated with methanol to the Judicial Investigation Organization (OIJ) confidential line at 800-8000-645, or by email to denuncias.drpis@misalud.go.cr, or by calling the National Center for Intoxicants at 2223-1028 or 800-INTOXICA (4686-9422). Additionally, if you feel you have been the victim of unregulated alcohol or another serious health violation, you should notify the American Citizen Services unit at the U.S. Embassy in San Jose at +506-2519-2000. You may also contact the U.S. Department of State – Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington, D.C. at 1-888-407-4747 (toll-free in the United States and Canada) or 1-202-501-4444 (from all other countries) from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays). Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy: If you are considering traveling to Costa Rica to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our ART and Surrogacy Abroad page . Water Quality: In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Adventure Travel: Visit the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel . General Health Language: The following diseases are prevalent: Dengue Chikungunya HIV/AIDS: Follow all standard procedures for protection against the spread of HIV/AIDS. Visit the UUnited States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in Costa Rica Air Quality: The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens People over 65 years of age People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. People with heart disease or diabetes People who work or are active outdoors","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. The Embassy is aware of isolated reports of uniformed officers or impostors demanding a bribe. Should you be confronted for a bribe, do not argue. Note the name of the officer and any identifying numbers on the uniform or vehicle and report the incident by calling “ 911 .” Ayahuasca/Kambo/Hallucinogens: Traditional hallucinogens, often referred to as ayahuasca or kambo, are often marketed to travelers as part of a “ceremony” or “spiritual cleansing.” Such substances typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong hallucinogen that is illegal in the United States and many other countries. Intoxicated travelers, including United States citizens, have been sexually assaulted, injured, or robbed while under the influence of these substances. Health risks associated with ayahuasca are not well understood, and, on occasion, United States citizens have suffered serious illness or death after taking these drugs. These incidents often occur in remote areas far away from modern medical facilities, increasing the risks. Alcohol/Drugs: Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs could land you immediately in jail. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe, including long jail sentences and heavy fines. The possession, purchase, and sale of marijuana and marijuana related products are illegal in Costa Rica Prostitution/Sex Tourism: Local law forbids promoting or facilitating the prostitution of another person. Local laws regarding human trafficking and child exploitation carry extremely harsh penalties, including large fines and significant jail time, including for first-time offenders. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the United States Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. The law permits pre-trial detention of persons accused of serious crimes. Due to overcrowding in local prisons, courts may instead use an “exit impediment.” Individuals subject to these measures cannot depart Costa Rica, must be able to support themselves, and must check in with judicial authorities on a regular basis. Defendants have the right to a public defender and an official translator for important hearings. Judicial Process: Due to differences in legal systems and case backlogs, local criminal and civil judicial processes can move slower in comparison to their United States equivalents. Civil suits on average take over five years to resolve. Some United States firms and citizens have satisfactorily resolved their cases through the courts, while others have seen proceedings drawn out over a decade without a final ruling. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTI events in Costa Rica. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Accessibility and accommodation are limited. Many buildings remain inaccessible and the Costa Rican Ombudsman’s Office has received several noncompliance reports regarding accessibility or malfunctioning of hydraulic wheelchair lifts for public transportation. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Residency: United States citizens seeking to live or reside long-term in Costa Rica should consider seeking local legal counsel for guidance on the requirements to obtain legal residency . Local authorities have imposed limited entry permits or deported United States citizens suspected of improperly using their tourist status to live in Costa Rica. Real Estate: Be extremely cautious when making real estate purchases or investments, consult with reputable legal counsel, and thoroughly review the contract. There is little the United States Embassy can do to assist United States citizens who enter into land or business disputes; you must be prepared to take your case to the local courts. Civil archives recording land titles are at times incomplete or contradictory. Coastal land within 50 meters of the high tide line is open to the public and therefore closed to development. The next 150 meters inland (“Maritime Zone”) cannot be owned by foreign nationals. Land in this zone is administered by the local municipality. Expropriation of private land by the Costa Rican government without compensation considered adequate or prompt has affected some United States investors. Property owners are encouraged to maintain security and access controls on any private property. Organized squatter groups have invaded properties, taking advantage of legal provisions that allow people without land to gain title to unused property. Victims of squatters have reported threats, harassment, and violence. Check the Embassy’s website for a list of local lawyers. Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Cote d'Ivoire,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are using simpler methods to attack. These include knives, firearms, and vehicles. They use them to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.). Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists. Places of worship. Schools. Parks. Beaches. Shopping malls and markets. Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights). Côte d’Ivoire still faces threats from violent extremist groups in the region. These groups are active across the borders of Burkina Faso and Mali. Côte d’Ivoire is not a base for these groups. Violent extremist groups in the region have stated they will target foreigners and/or countries that participate in counterterrorism efforts. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime is common. Property crime includes burglaries and car theft. Violent crime includes carjacking, armed robberies of homes and streets. Illegal firearms are readily available throughout the country. Banditry and other violent crimes continue. They happen day and night in the countryside. During holidays (including major Muslim and Christian holidays), robberies and opportunistic crimes increase. These crimes include burglaries of cars and homes. Criminals seldom harm victims of street crime if they comply with demands. Assailants have used violence if victims refuse to hand over valuables. Law enforcement is somewhat effective at deterring crime but lacks adequate resources. Security services often lack radios, guns, and cars. This severely limits their ability to respond. Many gendarmes and police stations outside of Abidjan have one vehicle for the whole precinct. They often get distress calls from the public via cell phone because they lack a centralized dispatch system. Responses to incidents of crime are often slow and generally limited to writing a report. The legal system lacks resources and tools to handle its current cases, and cannot jail criminals according to global standards. U.S. citizens should be careful when visiting the Abobo, Adjame, Angre, Koumassi, Marcory, and Yopougon districts in Abidjan. They should also be careful in popular night areas, including Plateau, Treichville, and Zone 4. Always carry identification to minimize the risk of harassment at police checkpoints. Uniformed police, military, and gendarmes routinely stop vehicles. They do so for traffic violations and security checks. If you find yourself at such a stop, politely present your identification. Police and security officials rarely speak English. Incidents of police or security force harassment or detention of foreigners are rare but do occur. If an officer asks you to pay a bribe, politely refuse and present a photocopy of your U.S. passport, visa, and entry stamp. There are weapons are left over from the civil war. They are a security threat. Criminals, rogue soldiers, and groups with common political views can exploit them. They pose an ongoing risk to Côte d’Ivoire’s fragile democracy. For more information, please see Côte d’Ivoire’s Travel Advisory . Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Election-related violence is another concern. The next presidential election is planned for 2025. Riots and demonstrations have occurred around elections. They have sometimes resulted in deaths. They may continue due to ongoing political tensions. For more information, please see Côte d’Ivoire’s Travel Advisory . International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Internet romance and financial scams are increasingly prevalent in Côte d’Ivoire. Scams often start with Internet postings or profiles. They can also start with unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/relative targeting Free trip/luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at +225-27-22-47-06-96, +225-01-03-79-91-44 (the Operations Center for the National Police), or 100/111 (the Ministry of Security in Plateau, Abidjan). Contact the U.S. Embassy at (+225) 27-22-49-40-00. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Help you find appropriate medical care. Assist you in reporting a crime to the police. Contact relatives or friends with your written consent. Give general info about the victim's role in the local investigation, and their role after it ended. Provide a list of local attorneys. Provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States . Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution. Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home. Replace a stolen or lost passport. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: Little formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists participate in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment may not be available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Piracy, armed robbery, and kidnapping for ransom pose big threats to U.S. ships in the Gulf of Guinea. They also threaten U.S. mariners on a ship or traveling to or from one in the Gulf of Guinea. Pirates target a variety of vessels, and it is not uncommon for them to fire upon vessels during boardings and attempted boardings. Please find the latest U.S. Maritime Advisory here . Weather Safety: The rainy season is from June to September. It often includes heavy rains and flash flooding. This is especially true in low-lying areas. Heavy rains have caused landslides, riverbank erosion, bridge washouts, and property damage. Roads may be closed suddenly and stay closed for indefinite periods of time, especially in more remote areas. U.S. citizens should watch local weather and news reports. They should avoid driving through flooded areas. And, they should keep water and emergency supplies at home.","Abidjan has privately-run medical and dental facilities that are adequate, but do not fully meet U.S. standards. Good physician specialists can be found, although few speak English. While pharmacies are well-stocked with medications produced in Europe, newer drugs may not be available. If you plan a lengthy trip to Côte d’Ivoire, you should bring enough medication to last the entire stay in your carry-on luggage. Medical care outside of Abidjan is extremely limited.

They cover specific issues. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Health Facilities in General: Adequate health facilities are available in Abidjan and other major cities, but health care in rural areas is below U.S. standards. Medicine and supplies are often scarce in public health facilities. The same is true in many rural medical facilities. Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. You can't always pay by credit card. Most hospitals and doctors require cash. Medical staff may speak little or no English. Generally, in hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities. Pharmaceuticals: Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and needing prescriptions in the United States, are often easy to buy with few controls. Counterfeit medication is common. It may be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Buy medication with a medical professional's advice. Buy it from reputable sellers.

They do this unless you ask for bottled water. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Adventure Travel: Swimming in coastal waters is dangerous and strongly discouraged, even for excellent swimmers. The ocean currents along the coast are powerful and treacherous, and numerous people drown each year. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel . General Health: The following diseases are prevalent: Diarrhea illness HIV/AIDS Malaria Meningococcal Disease Tuberculosis Yellow Fever Dengue The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend mosquito repellents. They also recommend sleeping under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays. HIV/AIDS: Data from UNAIDS Spectrum Estimates in February 2023 shows that Côte d’Ivoire has an HIV prevalence rate of 1.8 percent for 15- to 64-year-olds. The rates are higher for transgender individuals, female sex workers, and men who have sex with men: 23.6 percent, 18.54 percent, and 13.33 percent. Annually, there are approximately 7,700 new HIV infections (300 among children) and 10,300 AIDS-related deaths in Côte d’Ivoire. Air Quality: Visit AirNow for information on air quality at U.S. embassies and consulates. Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Côte d’Ivoire. Consider the impact of seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution on you. Consult with your doctor before traveling if needed. The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is worst during the harmattan season. This is a very dry time in West Africa when winds blow sand and dust from the Sahara Desert. It lasts from December to February. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens. People over 65 years of age. People with lung disease, such as asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). COPD includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. People with heart disease or diabetes. People who work or are active outdoors.","Criminal Penalties: U.S. citizens are subject to laws of the foreign countries they visit. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. People starting a business or practicing a licensed profession should seek information from local authorities. They should do this before starting to practice or operate a business. Furthermore, you can be prosecuted in the United States for some acts committed overseas, even if those acts are not illegal where they happened, for example, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Customs: Ivoirian customs authorities encourage the use of an ATA (Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission) Carnet. It is for temporary admission of professional equipment, samples, and goods for exhibitions and fairs. ATA Carnet Headquarters, at the U.S. Council for International Business, 1212 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036, issues and guarantees the ATA Carnet in the United States. For additional information, call (212) 354-4480 or email ATA Carnet Headquarters . Business travelers can bring laptop computers into the country without difficulty. Traveling with desktop computers or other electronics in large numbers may cause a problem. It may look like you're bringing them into the country to resell. Travelers should show a business reason for such equipment. They can use an ATA or submit a letter to the Director General of Customs to ask for temporary admission. If traveling to another West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) country, expatriate residents leaving Côte d’Ivoire must declare the amount of currency being taken out of the country. Residents visiting CFA Franc countries, but not WAEMU members, cannot take CFA Francs out of Côte d’Ivoire. They can carry up to 2,000,000 CFA Francs (about 4,000 USD) in other currencies. You can take funds more than that amount out of the country in the form of travelers or bank checks. If you travel to any non-WAEMU country, tourists can't take more than 500,000 CFA Francs (about 1,000 USD). Business operators can't take more than 2,000,000 CFA Francs (about 4,000 USD) without government approval. For more on customs rules, travelers can check the Ivoirian Customs Agency’s website . Corruption is a serious problem in Côte d’Ivoire. It affects judicial proceedings, contract awards, customs, and taxes. Police, military, and gendarmes routinely stop cars for traffic violations and security checks. If you are stopped, politely present your identification. Police and security officials rarely speak English. If you are stopped at one of these checkpoints and asked to pay a bribe, refuse politely. Then, present your photocopy of your U.S. passport, visa, and entry stamp.

However, same-sex marriage is not recognized under local law. The laws only mention same-sex sexual activity as a form of public indecency. It carries a penalty of up to two years in prison, the same as for illegal heterosexual acts. Antidiscrimination laws exist. But, they do not cover discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Societal stigmatization of the LGBTQI+ community is widespread. In the past, the LGBTQI+ community has accused the police, gendarmes, and soldiers of beatings, jailings, verbal abuse, extortion, and humiliation. Despite these allegations, relations between the LGBTQI+ community and law enforcement seem to be improving through enhanced communication. The few LGBTQI+ organizations in the country operate freely, but with caution. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Côte d’Ivoire bans discrimination against people with physical and mental disabilities. But, it is not well enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. According to the 2019 Human Rights Report, people with disabilities reportedly faced discrimination. This discrimination happened in employment and education. Prisons and detention centers provided no accommodations for persons with disabilities. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure in Abidjan and throughout the country. Rental, repair, and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices are scarce. The same is true for service providers, such as sign language interpreters and personal assistants. Contact the U.S. Embassy in Côte d’Ivoire to receive a list of providers. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Croatia,"Terrorism : Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking soft targets and are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, rudimentary IEDs and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively.

Curacao,"Crime: Crimes of opportunity are common, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, particularly at beaches, hotel lobbies, or from cars. Be aware of your surroundings and take precautions to secure personal property. Car theft is an increasing problem. Do not leave valuables in cars in plain view or unattended in unsecured hotel rooms and rental homes. Parking lots that are unattended and without access control are considered higher risk for car break-ins. Some beaches charge a fee for access and employ private security, which provides some deterrent to crime. Keep a copy of your valid U.S. passport in a secure location in case your passport is stolen. Violent crime, including rape and armed robbery – although not common – does occur. Exercise caution when visiting more isolated areas of the island. Some thefts and assaults have been reported near nature areas, remote beaches, and small or informal parking areas used by divers. If you are traveling with children, be aware that the legal drinking age of 18 is not always enforced, so extra parental supervision may be appropriate.  Take standard precautions when frequenting nightclubs and bars.

Police on both sides of the island strictly enforce these restrictions . Terrorism: Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible near-term attacks in Europe. All European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Terrorist groups, including their associates, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.

Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Cyprus generally has low crime rates. Be alert and always aware of your surroundings and of your personal belongings. Criminals often target those who are distracted, alone in an isolated area, or impaired. Do not leave any valuables unattended or out in public view. Avoid so-called “night clubs” (topless bars), as they reportedly employ women trafficked to Cyprus for sexual exploitation. Night clubs have presented foreign patrons with grossly-inflated bar tabs, threatening customers who refuse to pay.

Emergencies: dial 112 Police: dial 158 Firefighters and Rescue: dial 150 Emergency Medical Service: dial 155 Pickpocketing is problematic, especially in major tourist areas in Prague. Criminals operate in professional, highly organized groups and may be armed with simple weapons , so avoid direct confrontation. Do not leave your belongings unattended. High-risk areas include: public transportation, the city center, crowded areas and outdoor cafes. Victims of sexual assault report being drugged with rohypnol and other “date rape”-type drugs . Use caution when accepting open drinks at bars or clubs, and do not leave drinks unattended. Pedestrian traffic violations, such as jaywalking, may be enforced in Prague’s city center. Discretionary fines up to 2000 Czech crowns (about $100) may be applied. Refusal to pay may lead to a court procedure and an even higher fine. Streetcars have the right of way over pedestrians at crosswalks. Casinos and gaming establishments are government-regulated, but some have been affiliated with, or attracted the interest of, organized crime. Conduct currency exchanges at reputable banks or legitimate money kiosks. Pay close attention to the exact rate offered for the amount you wish to exchange, as rates may vary widely for smaller versus larger amounts and between different exchange offices. An offer to exchange currency by an unknown person on the street is most likely a scam . ATMs are widely available throughout major cities. Criminal organizations have used electronic “skimming” to steal card information and PIN numbers at some ATMs. Use ATMs at secure, monitored locations (commercial banks, large hotels, and the airport). Auto thefts and break-ins are common in the Czech Republic, especially in major cities. Use parking garages and anti-theft devices. Don’t leave valuables in plain sight inside vehicles, as this significantly increases the possibility of theft.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (D.R.C.),"See the Department of State Travel Advisory and Alerts for the DRC. The security situation in most parts of eastern DRC remains unstable due to the activities of rebel and other armed groups and ongoing military operations. Armed groups, individuals, and military forces routinely clash with each other. Civilians are frequently targeted in attacks and other illegal activities, such as kidnapping, forced taxation, and forced labor. Terrorist and armed groups operating in North Kivu and Ituri provinces have regularly attacked military and civilian targets and represent an ongoing threat to humanitarian aid workers and other NGO personnel operating in the area. Armed group violence has increased in parts of South Kivu. Sporadic but severe outbreaks of violence targeting civilians, including killing, rape, kidnapping, and pillaging, continue throughout North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika, Haut Lomami, Bas-Uele, and Haut-Uele and three Kasai provinces of Kasai Oriental, Kasai Central, and Kasai Provinces. Travelers in remote area of the country, especially in the eastern DRC, should travel with a minimum of two vehicles equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) and satellite phones. Road travelers are frequently targeted for ambush, armed robbery, and kidnapping. Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.

Crime: Crimes of opportunity (mainly for financial gain) are the most reported incidents of crime against U.S. citizens in Kinshasa and throughout the DRC. Most incidents involve theft such as pickpocketing, burglary, and robbery. Petty crime may be more likely in public places and areas of congregation. Criminal elements do not typically single out U.S. citizens, but may view them as targets of opportunity based on perceived affluence or vulnerability. Roadblocks: Security forces set up spontaneous roadblocks, especially after dark, to conduct vehicle searches and check identity papers. They may also solicit bribes. Remain inside your vehicle with doors locked and open the window slightly to communicate. Remain calm and, if threatened, do not resist. Demonstrations: Demonstrations and gatherings occur with increasing frequency and with little notice. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on significant holidays, and during international events. Police have at times responded to demonstrations with heavy-handed tactics that resulted in civilian casualties and arrests. In the eastern DRC, demonstrations can rapidly become extrajudicial mobs and turn violent, posing a threat to humanitarian aid workers and other personnel operating in the area. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.

Denmark,"Terrorism: Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack - including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Organized crime groups operate in Denmark, including in and around Copenhagen. Travelers should be aware of their surroundings and immediately leave the area if they feel threatened. In response to crime, police may establish “Search Zones” (“visitationszoner” in Danish) and stop and search individuals. Pickpockets and purse-snatchers operate aggressively in areas frequented by tourists, as well as on trains and buses, and at transit stations, including Copenhagen Central Station, Copenhagen Airport, and cruise ship quays. Do not place any bags containing valuables, such as your passport or credit cards, on the ground or on the back of a chair in public places, such as restaurants, bars, and cafes.  Watch your laptop and mobile devices, which are particularly desirable to thieves. U.S. citizens are encouraged to review the OSAC Crime and Safety Report for more information on crime in the Kingdom of Denmark. When traveling or living in the Kingdom of Denmark, you should: Be aware of the local security situation and take appropriate steps to bolster your personal security. Monitor media and local information sources , and factor updated information into personal travel plans and activities. Address specific safety concerns to Danish law enforcement authorities who have responsibility for the safety and security of all residents and visitors. Exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations. If stopped by the police, cooperate and be prepared to present identification. Freetown Christiania , located in the Christianshavn area of Copenhagen, is known for illicit drug activity . Drug enforcement efforts have resulted in clashes between the police and Christiania residents.  Christiania residents have imposed a strict no-photography policy; tourists have been assaulted and robbed for taking pictures. Police and emergency services are limited in Christiania. Demonstrations occur regularly in Denmark. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on holidays, or during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.

Dominican Republic,"Crime: Crime is a threat throughout the Dominican Republic. Tourist destinations are generally more policed than metropolitan areas. If robbed, hand over your personal belongings without resisting. Do not carry or wear valuable items that will attract attention. Be wary of strangers. Travel with a partner or group if possible. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Dating App Robberies: Several U.S. citizen travelers in the Dominican Republic have reported that they were robbed by people they met through popular online dating applications. If meeting with strangers, you should strongly consider meeting only in public places and avoiding isolated locations where crimes are most likely to occur. Demonstrations: Avoid areas of demonstrations and exercise caution if you are in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local tourist police (POLITUR) at 809-222-2026 or 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at 809-567-7775. 911 is operational throughout the country apart from some areas located near the Haitian border.

Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact POLITUR (809-222-2026), the National Police ( 809-682-2151), and the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Sexual Assault: Rape and sexual assault has been reported throughout the Dominican Republic, including at major resorts and hotels. Notes for your safety: U.S. citizens have been targeted with date rape drugs. Sexual assault victims in the Dominican Republic should not expect the totality of assistance offered in the United States. Rape kits are often not available until the following morning and must be administered by Dominican authorities. Victims often have to request medication to avoid transmission of STDs and reduce the chances of pregnancy. Prosecution of a rape case moves forward very slowly. Dominican law may require the victim to return to the Dominican Republic at some stages of the judicial process. Security outside of the resort area, including beach areas, is unpredictable, especially at night. Best Practices: Contact the police/hotel management if resort staff demonstrate unwanted attention. Victims of sexual/other assault should contact the police and the Embassy. Insist that hotel management take immediate action by contacting the police. In a resort, avoid secluded places. Always be accompanied by someone you know, even going to the restroom. Do not consume alcoholic beverages alone or with new acquaintances. Do not leave drinks unattended.  Know your limits and help your friends/travelling companions to remain safe. Shout for help immediately if threatened or made uncomfortable. Report suspicious activity, including excessive friendliness by hotel employees, to hotel management, the U.S. Embassy, and local police. Do not swim alone due to life-threatening undertows. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities may not commonly occur in all parts of the country. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in or near major cities or major tourist zones. First responders may be unable to access areas outside of major cities or major tourist zones. The ability to provide urgent medical treatment may be limited. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery. If you are considering travel to the Dominican Republic for cosmetic surgery, be mindful of the following: Have a medical evaluation from a U.S. doctor to determine if you are a good candidate for surgery. Before travel, carefully research the doctor (e.g. qualifications, experience performing the surgery, complication rate) and credentials of the recovery facility you plan to use.

Travelers with Disabilities: The law in the Dominican Republic prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced consistently. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Accessible facilities, information, communication/access to services and ease of movement is limited in most parts of the country. Large resorts and Santo Domingo may have some generally accessible infrastructure, but travelers should not expect the level available in the United States. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Disaster Preparedness: Register with the Embassy on or before your arrival through our travel registration website . In the event of a natural disaster or emergency, this will keep you informed.

Real Estate: Property rights are irregularly enforced, and investors often encounter problems in receiving clear title to land. Consult a reputable attorney before signing documents or closing on any real estate transactions. Real estate investments by U.S. citizens have been subject to legal and physical takeover attempts. Absentee landlords and absentee owners of undeveloped land are particularly vulnerable. Consider purchasing title insurance. Scams: Scammers often target elderly people by pretending to be a law enforcement official, an attorney, or a U.S. Embassy official, claiming that a loved one has been arrested overseas. The caller instructs the victim to wire money. Scammers sometimes impersonate family members, such as a scared grandchild. Contact the U.S. Embassy before wiring money to the Dominican Republic. When in doubt, try to contact your loved one directly."
Ecuador,"Exercise increased caution when traveling in Ecuador, and do not travel to the province of Carchi, the province of Sucumbíos, and the northern part of Esmeraldas province, including Esmeraldas city due to crime. U.S. government personnel may travel to the northern bank of the Napo River in Sucumbíos, where tourist lodges are located, an area approximately four miles wide, and to the portion of Esmeraldas province that is south of Esmeraldas city. All other U.S. government travel to the northern border area is prohibited without prior permission. This region has a high rate of violent crime. U.S. citizens are not targeted, but have been victims of crime there in the past. Crime: Crime is a widespread problem in Ecuador. Pick-pocketing, robbery, and hotel room theft are the most common crimes. Tourists have been robbed at gunpoint on beaches and along hiking trails. Passengers arriving at the Quito and Guayaquil airports have also been targets of armed robberies. Use hotel safes if available, avoid wearing obviously expensive jewelry or clothing, and carry only the cash or credit cards that you need. Stay alert in crowds and on public transportation. Be aware that thieves might create distractions to target you. Be alert for robberies, in which criminals enter a taxi and force victims to withdraw money from ATMs. Some victims have been beaten or raped. Avoid hailing taxis on the street. Order taxis by phone or use a service affiliated with major hotels. Avoid withdrawing large amounts of cash at one time. Use ATMs in well-protected indoor areas. To avoid carjacking or theft from your car while you are stopped at intersections, drive with your doors locked and windows rolled up. Do not leave valuables in plain view. Sexual assaults and rapes can occur, even in tourist areas. Travel in groups, do not leave food or drinks unattended, and never allow a stranger to give you a drink. Do not let your credit card out of your sight in order to avoid credit card “skimming.” Incapacitating drugs, such as rohypnol and scopolamine, have been used to facilitate violent robberies and sexual assaults. Civil Unrest: Demonstrations may occur occasionally. They may take place in response to local or international events or on politically significant holidays. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Protesters may block roads and sometimes burn tires, throw rocks, and damage property. Police may respond using water cannons and tear gas. Avoid demonstrations and prepare back-up transportation plans. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent with little or no warning. A disaster can disrupt food supply, so plan to have at least a 3-day supply of food and medicine on hand. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.

Visit Ecuador’s National Risk Management Secretariat and the Ecuadorian Geophysical Institute for more information. Mud or lava flows from Tungurahua volcano could pose a significant and immediate threat to travelers in Baños. The town of Latacunga is directly in the path of potential mud or lava flow from the Cotopaxi volcano . Even small emissions from the volcano can trigger avalanches and landslides. Low lying areas in the greater Quito area could also be affected if Cotopaxi erupts. Reventador volcano is located in Napo province and is one of the most active in the country.

Hallucinogens: Traditional hallucinogens, often referred to as ayahuasca or San Pedro, are often marketed to tourists as “spiritual cleansing” and typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong hallucinogen that is illegal in the United States, Ecuador, and many other countries. Health risks are not well understood, and, on occasion, people suffer serious illness or death after taking these drugs. Intoxicated travelers also have been assaulted and robbed. These incidents often occur a great distance from medical facilities, making the risks even greater. Galápagos Islands: Be aware of the following challenges: Many Ecuadorian tour vessels operating in the Galápagos do not meet international safety standards. Inquire about safety features when boarding vessels. The two hospitals on Santa Cruz and San Cristobal Islands do not perform major medical procedures. Serious injury or illness in the Galapagos typically requires medical evacuation to the Ecuadorian mainland or the United States. This can cost $60,000 or more and take significant time to arrange. We strongly recommend you purchase travel insurance that includes health coverage and air evacuation . There are limited decompression facilities for scuba divers. The Ecuadorian government restricts the entry of certain items into the Galapagos. Visit the Agency for Biosecurity and Quarantine Regulation and Control for the Galapagos for more information. Retiring in Ecuador: In recent years, Ecuador has become a top overseas destination for retiring U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens have reported unethical practices by lawyers, real estate agents, and others, resulting in costly losses and little hope of remedy through the local judicial system.

Egypt,"The Department of State Travel Advisory warns U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Northern and Middle Sinai Peninsula and parts of the Western Desert due to terrorism. (Tourists regularly travel to tour Southern Sinai destinations along the Red Sea, such as Sharm el-Sheikh, Dahab and Taba, as well as St. Catherine’s Monastery/Mt. Sinai. Travelers should review updated news reports for those areas prior to their travel.) Travel to the Libyan and Sudanese borders is also not recommended. Travel to the Black Desert and White Desert should only be done with a professionally licensed tour company and not self-drive. U.S. citizens in Egypt should maintain a high level of vigilance throughout the country due to the threat of terrorism. Terrorism : Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, and have targeted diplomatic facilities, tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, western businesses, resorts, and local government facilities. There is a possibility of terrorist attacks in urban areas, including in Cairo, despite the heavy security presence. The Egyptian government has attempted to address security concerns and has visibly augmented its security presence at tourist locations, but challenges persist, and the threat of terrorism remains. Police and military are also engaged in operations to combat terrorism and disrupt terrorist cells in the Sinai Peninsula and the Nile Valley. Do not travel to: The Northern and Middle Sinai Peninsula due to terrorism. The Sinai Peninsula remains a particularly dangerous area, with frequent terrorist attacks on security forces and civilians. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens anywhere in the Sinai Peninsula as U.S. government employees are not authorized to travel to these areas (with the exception of the beach resort of Sharm El-Sheikh; travel to Sharm El-Sheikh and points along the Red Sea coast.) The Western Desert due to terrorism. (Tourist regularly travel to the Black and White deserts but only with a professionally licensed tour company. They should avoid using their personal vehicle in these areas.) Egyptian border areas other than official ports of entry. Egypt’s borders are under military control; movement of non-military persons and vehicles is substantially restricted, and in some cases prohibited, within these areas. U.S. citizens should not travel in these border zones. It is illegal to photograph police stations, military barracks, and certain other sensitive public buildings. U.S. citizens are urged to remain alert to local security developments, avoid demonstrations, and be vigilant regarding their personal security at all times throughout the country. U.S. citizens should also carry identification and a cell phone or other means of communication that works in Egypt, and it is advisable to pre-program the U.S. Embassy’s telephone number (+20 2 2797-3300). Travelers must obtain permission and a travel route from the Egyptian Military Intelligence and the Tourist Police Headquarters via a local or overseas travel agency to access Egypt's frontiers, including the borders with Libya, Sudan, Israel, and parts of the Sinai Peninsula off paved roads. High concentrations of World War II-era unexploded landmines are located in the World War II battlefields along the Mediterranean coast west of Alexandria, the Eastern Desert between Cairo and the Suez Canal, and much of the Sinai Peninsula. Travelers are urged to be especially cautious in these areas. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime : Crime levels in Cairo and Alexandria are moderate. The vast majority of criminal acts against foreigners are crimes of opportunity, such as purse snatching and pickpocketing. Harassment of women, including foreigners, remains a serious problem. Incidents of harassment range from lewd comments and gestures to indecent exposure and inappropriate physical contact. Tourists should be alert to being overcharged for various services and for being victimized in scams common to tourist destinations worldwide. Tourists should expect to encounter aggressive vendors at Egypt’s shops in urban areas, as well as at the many temples and archaeological sites. Some will offer “free” gifts to tourists which, once accepted, lead to demands for money. Most sites have specially designated tourist police who can assist in uncomfortable situations. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. (If applicable) Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams : See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Egypt. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Tips to avoid scammers: Look for red flags like their location is far away, their profile was recently created or seems to be too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or they ask for money. Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages. Do a reverse image search on the profile picture. If they ask for help, you should refer to them to the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate so we can work with local authorities to assist. If you believe you have been scammed, report the incident to local law enforcement right away and stop all communications with the scammer. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers The U.S. Embassy receives frequent reports of online financial scams, often involving a fraudulent romantic partner requesting money for hospital bills or legal expenses to depart Egypt. Be skeptical about sending money to anyone known only through online contact. Technology Usage Abroad : Mobile Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration. Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault and domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Women who report sexual assault and domestic violence to local authorities have little recourse in Egypt, and women who report sexual crimes may be accused of adultery if they are unable to prove that a crime occurred under a high standard of evidence in the Egyptian judicial system. Report crimes to the local police at 122 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(20) 2-2797-3300. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. The Embassy cannot intervene in legal disputes. U.S. citizen tourists can forward their complaints for investigation to the Tourist Police Headquarters. For crimes involving children, you may call Egypt’s Child Emergency Help line by dialing 16000. Egypt’s National Council for Women provides some assistance to women who are victims of domestic violence, or other complaints, at phone number 15115 or website: http://www.oo-ncw.org .

We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health webpage and general Traveler Advice for Egypt. • Select your destination in the Travelers’ Health webpage. Review all sub-sections including the Travel Health Notices, Vaccines and Medicines, Non-Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Stay Healthy and Safe, Healthy Travel Packing List, and After Your Trip. • Review the Traveler Advice webpage that provide advice on medical considerations including: Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel) Travelers with Special Considerations (for example: Allergies, Long-Term Travelers and Expatriates) and General Tips (for example: Traveling with Medications, Travel Vaccines) The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. The U.S. Embassy strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. See the webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Medical Care: The Egyptian ambulance service hotline is 123. Emergency and intensive care facilities are limited. Most Nile cruise boats do not have a ship's doctor, but some employ a medical practitioner. Hospital facilities in Luxor, Aswan, and Sharm el Sheikh are adequate, but they are inadequate at most other ports-of-call. Although availability of ambulances is improving, getting them through Cairo traffic can be very challenging. Beaches on the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts are generally unpolluted. However, persons who swim in the Nile or its canals, walk barefoot in stagnant water, or drink untreated water are at risk of exposure to bacterial and other infections and the parasitic disease schistosomiasis (bilharzia). It is generally safe to eat freshly prepared cooked food in hotels, on Nile cruise boats, and in mainstream restaurants. When selecting a restaurant, travelers should select a clean and reputable place, eat only freshly prepared, cooked foods, avoid all uncooked food including raw fruits and vegetables. Tap water in some locations is not potable. It is best to drink bottled water or water that has been boiled and filtered. Well-known brands of bottled beverages are generally considered to be safe if the seal is intact. Although the Embassy cannot provide medical advice or provide medical services to the public, a list of hospitals and doctors in Egypt can be found on the Embassy website. Prescriptions: Travelers should carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with Egypt’s Ministry of Health to ensure the medication is legal in Egypt. Vaccinations: Travelers should be up-to-date on all recommended vaccinations, per CDC’s information. Further Health Information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: Travelers are subject to local laws. The Egyptian legal system is different from the legal system in the United States, with significantly different standards of evidence, due process, and rule of law. Travelers should be conscious of their behavior and how it may be interpreted by Egyptian authorities. If one violates local laws, even unknowingly, one may be denied entry, expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits, or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Egyptian police and security forces do not require probable cause in order to stop, question, and detain individuals. Failure to carry proper identification, such as a passport, may result in detention and questioning. Suspects may be detained without charges or access to immediate legal counsel for months during the investigative stage of a criminal case. U.S. citizens have been detained for several days or more in non-criminal cases, including immigration violations. Local laws prohibit protesting or demonstrating without a permit. Even being in the vicinity of anti-government protests can draw scrutiny from Egyptian police or security forces, including demands to search personal electronic devices. U.S. citizens have been detained for posting content on social media perceived as critical of Egypt or its allies. Punishments often can be harsher in Egypt for comparable crimes than they are in the United States. Penalties for drug offenses can be particularly severe, including life in prison or the death penalty. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Dual U.S.-Egyptian Citizens : Egyptian law considers dual nationals to be Egyptian citizens and thus the Egyptian authorities do not automatically notify the U.S. Embassy when a dual national is detained, or provide information about their alleged crime. Family members, friends, and/or traveling companions may notify the ACS Unit at U.S. Embassy Cairo if the arrested U.S. citizen is unable to do so. U.S. citizenship does not provide protection from detention or arrest by Egyptian authorities and individuals detained may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention.  U.S. citizens arrested for any reason in Egypt may be deported, even if they are not convicted of a crime.  Detained U.S.-Egyptian citizens have been asked by the Government of Egypt to renounce their Egyptian citizenship as a condition of their deportation to the United States. Consular officers must obtain authorization from Egyptian authorities to visit American detainees. Currency: Entering or exiting Egypt with more than $10,000 is prohibited. Attempting to enter or depart Egypt with any instruments of currency in the sum of more than $10,000 could result in the confiscation of the money over $10,000 and other penalties. Drones: Importation of all types of drones, including small civilian drones used for personal or touristic purposes is strictly prohibited. Potential penalties for violating are harsh, and a recently passed law authorizes the death penalty for using a drone in support of terrorist activity. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Cultural Property: Travelers should note that Egyptian law prohibits the unauthorized removal of antiquities (including historic coins, ceramics, and architectural elements) both from archaeological sites and other sources in Egypt. Egyptian law also forbids the intentional damaging of antiquities, such as inscribing or painting on them or attaching advertisements. The trade, sale, or export in antiquities is also heavily restricted and regulated. Travelers may be prosecuted if found to be looting or damaging archaeological sites, buying antiquities, or smuggling antiquities out of Egypt. Penalties include fines and/or imprisonment. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel information International Religious Freedom Report — see country reports Human Rights Report — see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers International Volunteers: Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: LGBTI individuals face significant social stigma and discrimination in Egypt. Egyptian law does not criminalize same-sex sexual activity, but LGBTI persons and advocacy groups have reported harassment, intimidation, arrests, and other forms of abuse, including by police. There are also reports that authorities have used social media, dating websites, and cell phone apps to entrap persons suspected of being gay or transgender in an act of “debauchery,” which is a criminal offense that carries sentences of up to 10 years. Police have confiscated rainbow flags and sometimes detained their owners. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and sections 1c and 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. ACCESSIBILITY: While in Egypt, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from in the United States. Businesses and institutions in Egypt generally do not make special accommodations for persons with disabilities, and Egyptian authorities do not enforce laws mandating access to transportation, communication, and public buildings by persons with disabilities. Pedestrian sidewalks and walkways are limited, uneven, high, and sometimes used by cars and motorcycles. Accommodations on public transportation are not offered for elderly individuals or persons with disabilities. Crosswalks are not in widespread use and motorists have the right of way. Pedestrians should exercise extreme caution. Students: See the Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: Many women travel safely each year without incident. However, when it comes to health and security, women travelers are more likely to be affected by religious and cultural beliefs of the foreign countries they visit. The truth is that women face greater obstacles, especially when travelling alone. Women, especially those traveling alone, should exercise particular care in crowds, on public transportation, in rural areas, and in isolated sections of temple and pyramid complexes. Women have been groped in taxis and while in public places. Women travelling alone or with children, including Westerners and U.S. citizens, may be stopped, questioned, or harassed by authorities for travelling without a male companion. Women and men of Egyptian heritage requesting overnight stay in hotel room may be asked to provide a marriage certificate to verify their relationship. The Embassy continues to receive reports of U.S. citizen women subject to domestic violence, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, and rape in Egypt. Some Egyptian NGOs provide assistance to victimized women within the Egyptian community. Women victimized overseas may be entitled to receive compensation for counseling and/or other services such as relocating back to the United States. Find more information about the specific risks that women face in Egypt through our Egypt Travel Advisory , the Country Security Report , and see our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
El Salvador,"The crime threat level in El Salvador is critical and our Travel Advisory warns U.S. citizens of the high rates of crime and violence. See below for additional information on crime. Dial 911 for emergency assistance in El Salvador. Protests: Demonstrations, sit-ins, and protests may occur at any time or place, but are most frequent in and around the capital San Salvador. Avoid demonstrations, because even apparently peaceful ones may turn violent. Follow local news media reports or contact the U.S. Embassy for up-to-date information. Crime: El Salvador has a high level of homicides and crimes such as extortion, assault, and robbery are common. Typical crimes in El Salvador include extortion, mugging, highway assault, home invasion, and car theft. Gangs have traditionally controlled a majority of the space in El Salvador, even if their presence is not visible to outsiders, and exist by extorting money from businesses, travelers, residents and others living in or passing through their territory. Non-compliance or resistance to gang demands often results in violence. This activity can occur even in wealthy and relatively peaceful areas. Home invasions and/or burglaries of residences during broad daylight occur in areas of San Salvador; in some cases, gangs simply expel residents from their homes and take over the property for criminal use.  U.S. citizens who visit El Salvador for extended periods may be at higher risk for extortion demands. El Salvador has tens of thousands of known gang members from several gangs including Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and 18th Street (M18). Gang members have been known to frequently engage in violence or use deadly force if resisted. The gangs, or “maras,” customarily have concentrated on extortion, violent street crime, carjacking, narcotics and arms trafficking, and murder for hire.  Extortion is a common crime in El Salvador. Many suspected gang members have been detained since March 27, 2022 under a State of Exception.  Reported crimes have reduced since that time, but crime in El Salvador remains at critical levels. U.S. Embassy personnel are advised to walk only in known, lit, well-secured locations. Criminals may be active even in popular parks with a security presence. Exercise caution at all times and practice good personal security procedures throughout your stay. Always travel in groups. Avoid remote or isolated locations. Avoid displaying or carrying valuables in public places. Avoid stopping at tourist overlooks, which may be targeted by criminals. Never leave passports and other important documents in vehicles. In public, remain alert and avoid the use of cell phones and earphones. These reduce your self-awareness and provide easy targets for crimes of opportunity. Do not travel on public transportation, especially buses. Use only radio-dispatched taxis, taxis stationed in front of major hotels, or internet-based rideshare services. Choose banks or ATMs inside secure, guarded areas and remain alert. Remain vigilant even in well-known restaurants, hotels, and retailers within San Salvador. Credit card cloning and similar fraud can occur; keep your card in sight. Be aware of your surroundings when traveling by car. Navigation apps seeking the quickest routes may direct you off safer routes into dangerous areas. Drive with your doors locked and windows raised. Avoid travel outside of major metropolitan areas after dark and on unpaved roads at all times because of hazardous road conditions and criminal activity. Criminals who threaten violence typically use violence without hesitation if victims do not comply instantly. Conversely, the Embassy has no reports of serious injury or worse among victims who comply. Armed robberies of climbers and hikers in El Salvador’s national parks can occur. Engage the services of a local guide certified by the national or local tourist authority when hiking in back-country areas and within the national parks. The tourist police force (POLITUR) provides security and assistance to tourists. Officers are located in 19 tourist destinations. Beware of hikes and guides in locations without an official guide service or police presence, regardless of advice found on the Internet. A majority of serious crimes in El Salvador are never solved. The Government of El Salvador lacks sufficient resources to properly investigate and prosecute cases and to deter violent crime. Do not purchase counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are counterfeit goods subject to seizure upon entry in the United States, but if you purchase them, you may also be exposed to legal liability in El Salvador. Victims of Crime: If you or someone you know becomes a victim of crime, report it to the local police by calling 911 and to the U.S. Embassy. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. The U.S. Embassy can: Replace a stolen or lost passport Help you find appropriate medical care Guide you on how to report a crime to police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Explain the local criminal justice process in general terms Provide a list of local attorneys Provide information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. If you are in immediate danger, call 911. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance . Watersports: Strong undertows and currents make swimming at El Salvador's Pacific Coast beaches extremely dangerous even for experienced swimmers. Government lifeguards are generally present at most public beaches but are not always present at private beaches. Follow all instructions of any lifeguard, and do not enter the water at any location at which red warning flags are displayed to signify dangerous conditions. In addition, El Salvador’s search and rescue capabilities are limited, and access to medical resources in beach areas is inadequate. Carefully assess the potential risks of recreational water activities and consider your physical capabilities and skills. Be aware that drinking alcohol and swimming can be a deadly combination.","For emergency services in El Salvador, dial 911. Private and public hospitals do not meet U.S. standards. The U.S. Embassy recommends that private hospitals be used only for emergency care to stabilize a condition prior to returning to the United States for definitive evaluation and treatment. Private hospitals and physicians expect up-front payment (cash or credit card). They do not bill U.S. insurance companies. Ambulance services are: not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment The Department of State does not pay medical bills. U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpa ge for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the Government of El Salvador to ensure the medication is legal in El Salvador. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. The following diseases are prevalent: Chikungunya Dengue Zika Diarrheal illness Vaccinations: All routinely recommended immunizations for the U.S. should be up-to-date. Measles, mumps, rubella , tetanus, pertussis and chickenpox are much more common than in the U.S., especially among children. Hepatitis A and typhoid immunization is recommended for all travelers. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all those who may have sexual contact, tattoos or require medical treatment while in El Salvador. Yellow Fever : Travelers coming from countries where yellow fever is endemic must have had a yellow fever vaccination in order to enter the country. For more information, visit El Salvador’s Immigration website . Tuberculosis is an increasingly serious health concern in El Salvador. For further information, please consult the CDC’s information on Tuberculosis . You can find detailed information on vaccinations and other health precautions on the following websites: Centers for Disease Control (CDC) World Health Organization (WHO)","State of Exception: In March 2022, the Government of El Salvador declared a 30-day “State of Exception” in response to an increase in homicides; the State of Exception has been extended several times since, and it continues today. The State of Exception suspended several constitutional rights, including the normal protections of criminal procedure such as the right to a speedy trial, among others. Several U.S. and other foreign citizens have been detained under the State of Exception, some in a reportedly arbitrary manner. The number of all detainees has increased significantly, and prison conditions are harsh. Criminal Penalties: While in El Salvador, you are subject to local laws. Your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest. Remember your activities are limited by the type of visa you have. If you violate Salvadoran laws, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in El Salvador are severe. (Please note that any items containing THC, even certain CBD products that are legal and widely available in the United States, are illegal in El Salvador) . Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Some offenses committed overseas can be prosecuted in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see the U.S. Department of State website and the Department of Justice website on crimes against minors abroad. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Prison and detention center conditions in El Salvador are harsh and dangerous. Overcrowding constitutes a serious threat to prisoners’ health and lives. In many facilities, provisions for sanitation, potable water, ventilation, temperature control, and lighting are inadequate or nonexistent. Guns: You must have a locally obtained license to possess or carry a firearm in El Salvador. Convictions for possessing an unlicensed firearm can carry a prison sentence of three to five years. The U.S. Embassy cannot intervene on your behalf. Disaster Preparedness: Preparation for natural disasters is essential in El Salvador, which has 21 active volcanoes, constant seismic activities, and a rainy season that produces severe flooding and mudslides. Find information about natural disaster preparedness on the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) website. Find information in Spanish about earthquakes (sismos) and other natural disasters in El Salvador on the Government of El Salvador’s web page . Learn more on our webpage about crisis and disaster preparedness . Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers . LGBTQI+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTQI+ events in El Salvador. There is, however, widespread discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, access to health care, and identity documents. Public officials, including the police, have reportedly engaged in violence and discrimination against LGBTQI+ persons. For more detailed information about LGBTQI+ rights in El Salvador, you may review the State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2018 . For further information on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTQI+) travel, please read our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page. Travelers with Disabilities: Salvadoran law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or the provision of other state services. The government, however, does not allocate sufficient resources to enforce these prohibitions effectively. There are few access ramps or provisions for the mobility of persons with sight and hearing disabilities."
Equatorial Guinea,"Crime: Though violent crime is rare, instances of violent burglaries/home invasions have occurred. Travelers have encountered anti-foreigner hostility from police and other officials, especially towards those of perceived Western or Chinese descent. Many situations, including petty or street crime and official harassment, have the potential to turn violent.  Security forces may stop people and request money. There has been a significant increase in attacks against women, including U.S. citizens, by small groups posing as taxi drivers and passengers. Victims typically are held captive for up to an hour, threatened at knifepoint, and robbed. Take taxis only in groups, use taxi drivers personally known to you, or avoid taxis altogether, especially in Bata. Be mindful of how much cash you have in your possession when entering a taxi and try to avoid carrying large sums of cash. Avoid dark alleys, remote locations, and traveling alone. Carry a copy of your passport and other pertinent documents at all times. Authorities may perceive notarized copies as more official than non-notarized copies. Political Violence : Demonstrations are not allowed, and therefore are rare. If you encounter a large gathering, avoid the area, as it is likely an illegal demonstration; the police will attempt to disperse the crowd, including through the use of force. Maritime Security : Piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea continues to increase. Pirates and armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property are common occurrences. Incidents may occur close to coastlines or in open seas. More information on current conditions may be found on the Office of Naval Intelligence’s piracy page . International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police in Malabo at 113 or nationally to the Equatorial Guinean Ministry of National Security at 666-555-532 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+240) 333-095-741 during business hours or (+240) 555-516-008 after hours.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. It is common to be asked to pay between $50 to $100 in order to file a police report or obtain a copy of a police report on file. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

Pharmacies in Malabo and Bata stock basic medicines including antibiotics but do not carry U.S. brand names or generic over the counter (OTC) medications. Outside of these cities, many medicines are unavailable. You should carry a supply of properly-labeled prescription drugs and other OTC medications adequate to cover your entire stay. Sanitation levels in hospitals are very low, except for the La Paz Malabo Medical Center, a Western level and acute care hospital which meets many of the medical standards of a modern hospital in a developed country. Doctors and hospitals often require immediate payment for health services in cash only (CFA). Patients are sometimes expected to supply their own bandages, linen, and toiletries.

Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. The following diseases are prevalent: Dengue Fever Diarrheal illness Polio Rabies Schistosomiasis Tuberculosis Yellow fever Malaria Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays. There are many counterfeit antimalarials throughout Equatorial Guinea and you should not plan on purchasing them after arrival.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws.

No antidiscrimination law exists to protect LGBTQI+ individuals. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance . Accommodation for individuals with disabilities is not mandated by Equatoguinean law, and travelers with disabilities are likely to encounter difficulties accessing transportation and public buildings. Although sidewalks often are available in major cities (especially in Malabo and Bata), road crossings are frequently uneven and curbs are usually in need of repair. Neither Malabo nor Bata has a public transportation system, and few vehicles are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Public buildings, including restaurants, bars, medical facilities, stores, and government offices, are rarely accessible and frequently have steps or partially obstructed entrances . Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: Rape and domestic violence are illegal in Equatorial Guinea. However, authorities do not enforce the laws effectively. See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Currency: Equatorial Guinea is almost exclusively a cash economy. Generally, credit cards and checks are not accepted, with the exception of a few Western hotels that cater to international business travelers and some restaurants and super markets. Credit card cash advances are not available. Most local businesses do not accept travelers' checks, dollars, or euros. However, dollars can be exchanged at local banks for Central African Francs (CFA). Cash in CFA is usually the only form of payment accepted throughout the country. ATMs are increasingly available in major cities. Although they are generally secure, travelers may find them out of order, so it is best not to rely on ATMs. You should also exercise caution when using a local bank or ATM as individuals may be waiting around to rob individuals with cash. In addition, you should not hail a taxi right outside of a bank or ATM. Photography: In the recent past, a special permit from the Ministry of Information and Tourism was required for virtually all types of photography in Equatorial Guinea. Although the law has changed, police or security officials may still attempt to fine or detain people taking photographs. Federal laws forbid taking photos of the Presidential Palace and its surroundings, military installations, airports, harbors, government buildings, and any other area the government deems as sensitive. Police and security officials have taken photographers into custody for perceived or actual violations of this policy, or to seize the camera (and/or cell phone) of persons photographing in the country. Also, the police may use this as a reason to try to extort money or threaten foreigners with torture or abuse. As these situations have the potential to become hostile, you should exercise prudence and caution while taking photographs."
Eritrea,"See the Department of State Travel Advisory for Eritrea . Eritrea experiences frequent water shortages and not all hotels have running water. Fuel shortages occur as well. Travel Permits: All foreign nationals, including U.S. Embassy officials, are required to obtain permits for travel more than 25 km outside of Asmara. Applications for travel permits are available at the two Ministry of Tourism offices located on Harnet Avenue and Airport Road. If you encounter difficulties while outside of the Asmara area, the Embassy’s ability to provide consular services may be limited. Use caution when traveling near the Eritrea-Ethiopia border area. Remain on major roads in the border region due to unmarked minefields. The Eritrea-Ethiopia border is closed; there is no legal means to travel between Ethiopia and Eritrea by land. Foreign nationals generally are not permitted to approach or cross the Djibouti-Eritrea land border. There are landmines, particularly in Nakfa, AdiKeih, Arezza, the 25-mile-wide region (40 km) between the Setit and Mereb Rivers, and in areas north and west of Keren, areas near Massawa, Ghinda, Agordat, Barentu, Dekemhare, and south of Tessenae. Certain remote Eritrean islands have military facilities and are not accessible to tourists. Crime: The Embassy is unable to quantify actual rates of crime as Eritrea does not publicly provide crime statistics, but crimes do occur and police have limited capacity to investigate. While most reported criminal incidents in Asmara involve crimes of opportunity, car and home burglaries and sexual assaults are also reported. U.S. citizens are encouraged to implement personal security practices such as: Avoid walking alone, especially at night. Do not display cash and valuable personal property. Maintain a low profile. Avoid doing anything that draws attention to you or your family. Remain alert to what is going on around you.

For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website . U.S.-Eritrean Dual Nationals: Eritrea does not recognize dual nationality. Dual U.S.-Eritrean citizens are considered Eritrean nationals by the Eritrean authorities. This limits our ability to provide consular services for dual nationals. Dual nationals may be subject to certain obligations, including taxes and conscription into national service. Proof of payment of the two-percent income tax is required to obtain any civil documents (e.g., birth certificates, educational transcripts, property ownership records, court records).

You must declare all foreign currency brought into Eritrea in excess of $10,000 (or the equivalent) and on departure you must prove that any missing foreign currency was exchanged at a branch of the Himbol or provide receipts for the items you purchased. The Eritrean government prohibits travelers from taking more than 1,000 Nakfa out of Eritrea. Violators may have the money confiscated and/or be detained.

Estonia,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) The current Department of State Travel Advisory assesses Estonia at Level 1, indicating travelers should exercise normal precautions when coming to the country.  There is minimal risk from terrorism in Tallinn.  There are no known homegrown terrorist organizations in Estonia, which is not a known base of support/sympathy for terrorists. Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe.  European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks.  All European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: There is minimal risk from crime in Estonia.  Pickpocketing, theft, and petty crime do occur, particularly in crowded areas and areas where tourists and foreigners congregate.  Pickpockets use various diversionary tactics to distract victims; one method involves bumping the victim in an effort to draw their attention to one individual, while another takes their wallet.  Victims should report the crime to the police and cancel their credit cards as soon as possible. The majority of incidents affecting U.S. citizens involve individuals who are alone and/or intoxicated at night.  Visitors who consume alcohol should exercise moderation and designate a sober member of the group to be in charge of security awareness.  Statistics indicate incidents against individuals based on race, religion, or sexual orientation/gender identity are limited; however the Embassy has received reports of U.S. citizens being harassed due to their race. Demonstrations: Large demonstrations occur infrequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable and U.S. citizens should exercise caution if within the vicinity of any demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Estonia.  Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters.  Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.  Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.  Report crimes to the local police at 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(372) 668-8128.  Victims of crime may also call 116 006 to contact Estonia’s Social Insurance Board’s Victim Support and Prevention Services Department to speak to a victim support worker.  For social welfare emergencies, such as domestic violence or child abuse, dial 112 (English-speaking operators are sometimes available).  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States Assist you with a list of non-governmental organizations and centers providing a number of programs for victims of crime in Estonia.

Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line for police, ambulance, or fire in Estonia is 112.  Many, but not all, operators speak English. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules [with regards to best practices and safety inspections] are regularly enforced.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","Medical care in Estonia falls short of Western standards outside the larger cities such as Tallinn, Tartu, and Pärnu.  Many medical professionals in Estonia are highly-trained, but some hospitals and clinics still suffer from a lack of equipment and resources.  Many doctors speak at least some English but most nursing staff speak only Russian or Estonian. For emergency services in Estonia, dial 112. Ambulance services are widely available. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

General Health Information: The following diseases are prevalent: Like much of Europe, outbreaks of measles are frequent in Estonia and travelers should have two documented doses of MMR vaccine prior to traveling. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme-disease are widespread throughout the country.  Use CDC recommended insect repellents containing either 20% DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535 to help diminish bites from ticks and other insects if you intend to visit parks or forested areas (even within parks in Tallinn).  Those who will be camping or have prolonged outdoor exposure should pretreat clothing and equipment with permethrin. There are no vaccines against Lyme disease.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws.  If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. The Estonian legal system takes a zero-tolerance approach to driving under the influence and even one drink can lead to a DUI arrest and could immediately land you in jail. In Estonia, everyone is required by law to wear small reflectors on clothing when it is dark outside.  Fines for refusing to wear the reflectors range from $50 to $500. Special Circumstances: Estonia is part of the Eurozone and only euros are accepted. Bank and currency exchange counters may refuse to accept U.S. currency that is crumpled, torn, discolored, or defaced. ATMs are widely available in Tallinn and in major towns. Contact the Embassy of Estonia in Washington for specific information regarding customs requirements. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.

Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTQI+ events in Estonia.  Estonian law prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics, and the government generally respects these prohibitions.  While the law is not specific regarding the forms of sexual orientation and gender identity covered, in practice all are understood to be included.  However, social acceptance of LGBTQI+ identity in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. LGBTQI+ travelers should consider exercising caution when visiting Estonia, especially when expressing affection in public, as local advocacy groups report incidents of verbal or physical assault based on perceived LGBTQI+ identity. See the English-language website of the Estonian visitor’s bureau for specific information regarding the LGBTQI+ community in Estonia . See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Estonia prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Estonia has few English language speaking medical interpreters, personal assistants, etc. as well as limited availability of specialized medical equipment.

Ethiopia,"Terrorism: Al-Qa’ida and its regional affiliate, Somalia-based al-Shabaab, maintain a presence throughout East Africa. In late 2020, Ethiopian security officials announced the arrest of al-Shabaab and ISIS members who were accused of planning attacks in Addis Ababa and other parts of Ethiopia. Current information indicates that terrorist organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens and Western targets and interests in East Africa, as well as against high-profile targets within those countries that contribute troops to the African Union Mission in Somalia, including Ethiopia. Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Civil Unrest: Ethiopia has experienced sporadic and spontaneous civil unrest throughout the country, some of which has ended in violence. During such episodes, the Ethiopian government often curtails or limits mobile telecommunications, internet access, and social media. If this happens, you may be unable to contact family and friends or emergency services. The U.S. Embassy does not provide internet access to private individuals. U.S. government personnel must request permission for personal and official travel outside of Addis Ababa and are required to carry personnel tracking devices and, in some cases, satellite phones. U.S. government personnel may not take personal trips to: All national border regions of Ethiopia Gambella (except Gambella City) Benishangul Gumuz (except Assosa City) Some areas in western and southern parts of Oromia region Tigray region Amhara region U.S. government personnel may only travel to Gambella City and Assosa City by plane. Western areas of Oromia: Wollega zones that include Kellem Wollega, West Wollega, Horro-Guduru Wollega and parts of East Wollega have reported civil unrest including fighting involving armed groups. Southern areas of Oromia: West Guji zone has reported civil unrest including fighting involving armed groups. Ethiopia’s Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People’s Region (SNNPR): Civil unrest in the region, particularly in Bench Sheko Zone and Konso Special Woreda, has resulted in deaths, looting, and the burning of buildings. Border with Kenya: There have been numerous incidents of inter-ethnic conflict reported near the border areas with Kenya, as well as attacks attributed to the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA or OLF-Shane). Criminal activity in this border area remains a concern. Tigray and Border with Eritrea: Due to conflict in the region, Tigray and the border with Eritrea are currently off-limits for U.S. government personnel. Due to the current situation in Tigray, the border roads with Eritrea are closed. Conditions at the border may change with no warning. Border with South Sudan (Gambella Region): The security situation in the region is volatile. Sporadic inter-ethnic clashes are common along the western border area with South Sudan. Past tribal conflict between Anyuak, Nuer, and Highlanders resulted in numerous casualties. As with other border areas, landmines and criminal activity remain a concern. Border with Sudan: There have been numerous incidents of armed clashes reported near the border area between Sudan and Ethiopia over disputed land. Somali Region (eastern Ethiopia): Al-Shabaab maintains a presence in Somali towns near the Ethiopian border, presenting risk of cross-border attacks and kidnapping. As with other border areas, landmines and criminal activity remain a concern. U.S. government personnel may not take personal trips to the Somali region. Afar: Violent crime, including the armed assault of foreigners, has occurred in the Danakil Depression in Afar. While recent reports may indicate the Danakil Depression area is safe for tourism, please note that tourism was previously targeted for attacks in 2007, 2012, and 2017. It is not recommended to use the Mekelle route to this or other tourist sites in the Afar region due to the current situation in the Tigray region. Travelers should remain alert for changing conditions and the potential for criminal activity in these areas. Travel to areas bordering Tigray is not recommended due to conflict in that region. Additionally, ethnic conflicts between Afar and Somalis in the southern border areas of Afar have been reported. Amhara: As a result of the Tigray conflict, tensions continue to exist along the Amhara-Tigray regional border, with occasional clashes including gunfire. Ethnic violence has been reported. While attacks are mostly related to inter-ethnic disputes and foreigners have not been targeted, attacks can occur at any time with the risk of being caught in violence. If you are travelling in the area, monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities. Crime in Addis Ababa: Pickpocketing, purse snatching, theft from vehicles and other petty crimes are common in Addis Ababa. Theft of passports is common in Bole International Airport, including inside the airport terminal and during airport transfers. Thieves are active throughout the city at all times, particularly on Bole Road, in the Piazza, the Merkato, and other areas frequented by tourists and foreigners. Violent robberies have also occurred in this area, with victims stabbed or beaten. Further, a number of violent robberies on hikers in Entoto Park, Yeka Park (behind the British Embassy), and the Guellele Botanical Gardens in Addis Ababa have been reported. Safety Precautions: Review your personal safety and security posture, remain vigilant, and exercise caution when visiting prominent public places and landmarks where westerners gather on a routine or predictable basis. Avoid unattended baggage or packages left in any location, including in taxis. Monitor consular messages. Avoid travel outside of major towns, particularly along border areas (Kenya, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, and South Sudan). Avoid walking alone. Do not display cash and valuable personal property. Secure your valuables and travel documents. Drive with doors locked and windows closed or rolled up enough at all times to prevent theft while stopped in traffic. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

There have been periodic detentions and interrogations of some LGBTI persons, and alleged physical abuse. Ethiopians do not generally publicly identify themselves as LGBTI due to severe societal stigma. There are some reports of violence against LGBTI individuals; reporting is limited due to fear of retribution, discrimination, or stigmatization. There is no law prohibiting discrimination against LGBTI persons and some LGBTI activists have reported being followed and at times fearing for their safety. Outside the major international hotels, same-sex couples may be unable to share a room. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights Report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: See The Ethiopian Center for Disability and Development guidebook with information on accessible hotel accommodations and transportation (including the new Addis Ababa metro).

Domestic violence and rape cases often are delayed significantly and given low priority. Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is illegal, but the prohibition is not actively enforced. Many women and girls have undergone FGM/C. It is much less common in urban areas. See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Natural Disasters: Ethiopia’s geographic location in the western escarpment of the Great Rift Valley and the Horn of Africa increases its vulnerability to natural disasters, including flooding (and related landslides) during the summer rainy season, drought, and seismic events."
Fiji,"Public Safety: Although demonstrations are not common in Fiji, you should avoid marches and large crowds, remembering that even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent unexpectedly. Crime: Crime: Remain cautious and alert in public places. Urban areas experience a higher incidence of crime than rural areas, but there are specific locations to avoid. Most crime is opportunistic. If you are not familiar with an area, ask hotel staff about areas to avoid. Several assaults and robberies have occurred in the bar and nightclub district of downtown Suva, the waterfront/seawall area during hours of darkness, as well as on Victoria Parade Street. Consider taking door-to-door transportation. Violent robberies and assaults continue to occur within the Colo I Suva Forest Park and as of July 2023 there is no security presence on the trails. Be attentive to your personal safety and be cautious about sharing too much personal information about where you are from and where you are staying while traveling. Reports of sexual assault against female tourists have increased. You should not walk alone after dark and always be sure to avoid isolated and deserted areas.

Fijian law also prohibits discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation; however, there are no laws specifically prohibiting discrimination against LGBTQI+ persons in other areas. LGBTQI+ travelers may encounter difficulties when pursuing adoption, marriage, devolution of property on death and pension, and holding public office. Fijian law does not criminalize consensual same-sex sexual activity and recognizes male-on-male rape as a crime. In general attitudes toward LGBTQI+ individuals have become more accepting, especially among the young, and articles promoting tolerance are regularly found in the media. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance. All persons are considered equal under Fijian law, and discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, provision of housing and land, or provision of other state services is illegal. Statutes provide for the right of access to places and all modes of transport are open to the public. Public health regulations include penalties for noncompliance; however, there is little or no enforcement of laws protecting persons with disabilities. Building regulations require new public buildings to be accessible to persons with disabilities, but only a few existing buildings meet this requirement. Under the Health and Safety at Work Act, all new office spaces must be accessible to persons with disabilities. The number of disabled-accessible vehicles in the country is small. There are some special schools for persons with physical, cognitive, and sensory disabilities, but cost and location limit access. Opportunities for a secondary school education for those with disabilities are very limited. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips .

Finland,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Crime : Finland has a low rate of crime and violent crime is uncommon.  Keep an inconspicuous profile and remain aware of your surroundings at all times. The most common criminal threat is petty street crime such as pickpocketing.  Avoid leaving personal possessions unattended while in public. The most serious criminal threat is a lone-wolf terrorist attack.  Finland had one such attack in 2017, resulting in two fatalities and eight injuries. Motorcycle gangs and Russian organized crime have a limited presence in Finland, but expatriates are unlikely to encounter them. Remain vigilant with regard to your personal security and exercise caution. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.

French authorities have spoken publicly about the heightened threat conditions for terrorist attacks in Europe. A counterterrorism law enacted in 2017 allows the government to prevent the circulation of individuals and to create zones of protection and security. The French government has temporarily reestablished border controls at its borders with its Schengen neighbors and movement may be restricted in some areas. Border controls with the United Kingdom, including the Channel Tunnel crossing, have also been reestablished following Brexit. The Government of France routinely conducts security and crisis management drills involving deployment of security forces, emergency services, and police to high profile areas that may be near popular tourist sites. U.S. citizens should be aware of the possibility of drills and should heed instructions of local authorities should they encounter them. French police and military routinely patrol public spaces. You should expect security inspections (to include purses, bags, and backpacks) at the entrance to large public venues and businesses. When traveling or living in France, you should: Be aware of your local security situation and take appropriate steps to bolster your personal security. Monitor media and local information sources like France24 , Radio France International , The Local , and the Paris Travel Information webpage and factor updated information into personal travel plans and activities. Address specific safety concerns to French law enforcement authorities who have responsibility for the safety and security of all residents and visitors to France. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program ( STEP ) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency. Crime: The majority of crimes directed against foreign visitors, including U.S. citizens, involve pick-pocketing (passports, phones, cash, credit cards), vehicle and residential break-ins, bicycle theft, and other forms of theft. Visitors to congested and popular tourist areas (e.g., museums, monuments, train stations, airports, and subways) should be particularly attentive to their surroundings. Rental cars are frequently targeted for break-ins when visitors exit their vehicles and leave valuables behind. Crimes of opportunity are more likely to involve violence on the street late at night or when the victim resists. Exercise extra caution when out alone at night and/or consider traveling out at night with trusted companions. While the incidence of sexual assault is statistically low, attacks do occur. Be aware of “date-rape” drugs, which are present in France. The Embassy has assisted multiple victims who appear to have been targeted using these drugs. Be cautious in bars and clubs where alcohol is served, and do not leave your drink unattended or accept a drink from strangers, as they may have slipped drugs into the drink. There are high incidences of “smash and grab” robberies in economically depressed areas or on highly traveled thoroughfares such as roads to and from the airport. Thieves on foot or motorcycle will approach a vehicle that is stopped in traffic, smash a window, reach into the vehicle to grab a purse or other valuable item, and then flee. Keep doors locked and valuables out of sight. See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Demonstrations occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Strikes can interfere with travel plans and increase expenses of traveling to France. Demonstration organizers must obtain prior police approval, and police routinely oversee participants.

While in French Polynesia, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation different from what you find in the United States. The law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, and the provision of other state services. The French Polynesian government generally enforces these provisions effectively. French Polynesia subscribes to laws that require disability accommodations, and many new buildings with public or community space are accessible. Many existing buildings as well as transportation systems do not yet meet these requirements. Accessibility is a requirement, however, for new construction.

Gabon,"Political rallies and social protests may occur spontaneously in Gabon, particularly in Libreville and Port Gentil. Even gatherings intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational or violent. Be aware of your surroundings and personal security at all times. Avoid large gatherings, protests, demonstrations, and any other event where crowds congregate. Police and security forces typically disperse crowds using tear gas or other force. Crime: Muggings, pick-pocketing, and theft of unattended possessions are the most common forms of crime visitors encounter. There have been reports of violent crime, including armed robbery. Vehicle break-ins and residential burglaries continue to be a problem in Libreville and Port Gentil. Carry identification at all times to minimize the risk of harassment at police checkpoints. Avoid poorly lit streets and unfamiliar areas of the city, especially at night. Avoid beaches after dusk.

City hall offices in Gabon can authenticate passport photocopies for a nominal fee. Photography: Taking photographs of the Presidential Palace, airport, and military or other government buildings is strictly forbidden. Official Corruption: Official corruption is common, but paying bribes is strongly discouraged and may make you a target for further attempts at securing bribery payments.

Georgia,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations continue to plot possible attacks throughout Europe. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Adjacent Areas: The United States and most other countries consider these regions part of Georgia. However, de facto local authorities claim independence, and Russian troops and border guards occupy both regions. Attacks, criminal incidents, and kidnappings have occurred in and around the areas. While none of the activity has been anti-American in nature, there is a high risk of travelers finding themselves in a wrong place/wrong time situation. Follow the guidance in our Travel Advisory for Georgia and do not travel to these regions. If you choose to travel there, you should be aware: U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling to the Russian-occupied regions of Abkhazia or South Ossetia. We are unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in either territory. U.S. government employees also are restricted from traveling within five kilometers of the administrative boundary line (ABL) dividing these regions from Tbilisi-administered territory. The administrative boundary line (ABL) of South Ossetia is not clearly marked in many places and frequently moving in other places. There is an elevated risk of wandering into South Ossetia unknowingly while hiking, particularly on the ABL’s eastern side , which could result in detention by security forces. Unexploded ordnance left over from previous conflicts pose a danger near the administrative boundary line of South Ossetia. You may only legally enter these regions from the Georgian side, per Georgian law. You may be arrested, detained, imprisoned, and/or fined by Russian, Georgian or de facto authorities if you enter without proper documentation. Medical services in the occupied territories are extremely limited. Hospitals do not accept credit cards or medical insurance, have little to no infectious disease control, and lack medicine. There are no commercial airports in either region making air ambulance evacuations impossible during medical emergencies. It is illegal to undertake any type of economic activity in Abkhazia or South Ossetia that requires permits, licenses, or registration, per Georgian law. Laws also ban mineral exploration, money transfers, and international transit via Abkhazia or South Ossetia. Pankisi Gorge: The Department of State cautions U.S. citizens against travel to the Pankisi Gorge region (north of the villages of Matane and Chorale, to the border with Russia, including the city of Duisk) because of the current security environment and the potential for civil unrest. There are restrictions on U.S. Embassy personnel traveling to this region or within five kilometers of it. While the Georgian government has had success in combating terrorism within its borders, U.S. citizens should remain vigilant. ISIS recruiting has occurred in Pankisi in the past, and some known terrorists have confirmed ties to the Pankisi Gorge region. Crime : Criminals may target foreigners. Take precautions against becoming a victim of crime as you would in any large city. Firearms are readily available in Georgia, assailants may be armed, and disputes with firearms could occur. Alcohol consumption is prevalent and has been attributed to escalating or exacerbating otherwise minor disputes. Carrying pocket knives or other cutting devices in Georgia is illegal under most circumstances .  You may be detained or cited if found in violation. There has been an increase in reports of “ confidence scams” where a traveler who orders drinks or food in a bar or restaurant is presented with a bill for exorbitantly high sums and then physically threatened if they do not pay. These are sometimes combined with “ romance scams ” wherein a traveler is taken to these establishments by someone they met online through a dating or other social meetup site. U.S. and other visitors have reported occurrences of sexual assault in Georgia. Avoid walking alone at night . Exercise caution when riding alone in private taxis or “marshrutka” mini buses.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be fined, arrested, deported, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or praticing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. If arrested, you may be held in pre-trial detention for up to nine months. Review the State Department’s page on Arrests or Detention of U.S Citizens Abroad. Furthermore, some lawsare also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Notification to U.S. Embassy Tbilisi of the arrest of U.S. citizens is typically significantly delayed in Georgia. In addition, the Georgian police have the authority under the Administration Violation Code to detain individuals for up to 24 hours without court intervention and 48 hours with court approval (this is referred to as “administrative detention”). There are no due process rights assigned during an administrative hold, meaning the person has no right to counsel. Special Circumstances : Georgia has strict regulations concerning: Possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in accordance with Georgian laws and controlled substance classifications. Penalties are severe and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. The import or export of alcohol, tobacco, jewelry, religious materials, art or artifacts, antiquities, and business equipment. Export of items of historical value , such as artwork, antiques, jewelry, or paintings. You must obtain a license. Contact the Embassy of Georgia or see our customs regulations webpage.

The government has until this year (2023) to develop an implementation action plan and 15 years to complete accessibility of government buildings, infrastructure, and services. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited or nonexistent in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.

Germany,"Terrorism: Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack –including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, and celebratory gatherings) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Violent crime is rare in Germany, but can occur, especially in larger cities or high-risk areas such as on large metropolitan subway systems and in train stations, primarily during late night or early morning hours. Most incidents of street crime involve the theft of unattended items and pickpocketing. Theft and pickpocketing primarily take place at train stations, on public transportation, at tourist attractions, and at large public events. Always pay close attention to your valuables! Be cautious and aware of your surroundings. U.S. citizens should exercise caution when congregating in known expatriate hangouts. Don’t buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. They are illegal to bring back into the United States, and you could also be breaking local law. Demonstrations: Demonstrations occur regularly in Germany. Large, public demonstrations take place for a variety of political and economic issues. Demonstrations tend to take place on politically significant holidays like German Labor Day (May 1) and during international summits hosted in Germany.  Demonstration organizers must obtain prior police approval, and police routinely oversee participants. Demonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Strikes may interfere with travel plans. We strongly encourage travelers to check transportation schedule information prior to travel. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Germany. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Most scammers pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Tips to avoid scammers: Look for red flags like their location is far away, their profile was recently created or seems to be too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or they ask for money. Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages. Do a reverse image search on the profile picture. If they ask for help, you should refer to them to the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate so we can work with local authorities to assist.

Armed robbers also sometimes target vehicles coming from Kotoka International Airport. If your car is hit by another car while you are driving, go directly to the nearest police station to report the incident. Reports of residential robberies continue to be on the rise. Street crime remains a serious problem in Accra and other large cities. Thieves carry out crimes of opportunity, such as “snatch & grabs,” on city streets in isolated areas as well as from vehicles idling in traffic. Pickpockets are also prevalent in crowded areas. Luggage and travel document theft occurs at Kotoka International Airport in Accra and in hotels across Ghana. Keep your documents secure at all times, and don’t leave your baggage unattended. Be wary of all offers of unsolicited assistance at the airport from anyone other than uniformed porters or officials. Credit card fraud is common. Exercise caution when using credit and ATM cards in Ghana. It is very common for scammers to tamper with credit card terminals. Skimming is the primary means of credit card fraud, and is undetectable until fraudulent charges appear on statements. If you choose to use a credit card anywhere in Ghana, monitor your credit card activity closely.

The government does not systematically or overtly discriminate against persons with disabilities, but such persons may experience societal discrimination. Furthermore, the law provides persons with disabilities access to public buildings “as far as is practical.” However, most buildings, transportation, and educational facilities do not provide for people with special needs. Because many streets are unpaved or not well-maintained, and sidewalks are not prevalent, individuals in wheelchairs or who have difficulty walking face challenges. Students :  See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers : Rape is a crime in Ghana punishable by five to 25 years in prison. However, rape is significantly underreported and remains a serious problem. Domestic violence is a crime punishable by up to two years in prison and/or a fine.

Greece,"Terrorism: Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible near-term attacks in Europe. All European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. In the past year, there have been multiple terrorist attacks in Europe. Extremists continue to focus on tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities as viable targets. In addition, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, high-profile events, educational institutions, airports, and other soft targets remain priority locations for possible attacks. U.S. citizens should exercise additional vigilance in these and similar locations. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Strikes and Demonstrations: Domestic strikes, demonstrations, and work stoppages are common throughout Greece and can become violent. Stay informed through local news, hotel security, the U.S. Embassy website , and the Consular Section’s Facebook page . Enroll in STEP to receive alerts sent by the Embassy. Transportation sector strikes interrupt traffic, public transportation, taxis, seaports, and airports. Confirm domestic and international flights before heading to the airport.

Demonstrators frequently congregate in the Polytechnic University area, Exarchia, Omonia, and Syntagma Squares in Athens; and at Aristotle Square, Aristotle University, and the Kamara area in Thessaloniki. Violent anarchist groups have joined public demonstrations to clash with police and vandalize public and private property. Crime: Crimes against tourists, such as pick-pocketing and purse-snatching , occur at popular tourist sites and on public transportation, especially the metro. A common tactic is one person causes a commotion on the metro or pushes travelers to distract them while another person snatches the belongings. Thieves also seek out and break into rental cars to steal passports, valuables, and luggage. The Embassy has received reports of alcohol-induced attacks targeting individual tourists at some holiday resorts and bars. Take the following precautions: Be cautious and aware of your surroundings. Do not leave bags unattended, especially on the metro and the Athens Airport train or in your vehicle. Avoid standing near bus or train doors.

LGBTI Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTI events in Greece. LGBTI individuals in Greece are protected by anti-discrimination laws, and gender identity is among the grounds covered by laws against hate speech; however, non-governmental organizations report that social discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity is widespread in Greece and violence against LGBTI individuals remains a problem. See our LGBTI travel information page and section six of our Human Rights Report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: While Greek law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or intellectual disabilities and local law requires access to buildings, sidewalks, and public transportation, application and enforcement of these laws is lacking. Handicapped parking spaces and sidewalk ramps are often occupied or blocked by parked vehicles. Sidewalks often are narrow with broken paving stones and large holes and obstructed by trees and street signs. Buildings with ramps might lack accessible elevators or bathrooms. A small percentage of public buildings (primarily in Athens) have full accessibility. Some buildings and intersections include accommodations for visually-impaired travelers. The Athens metro and Athens International Airport are fully accessible with ramps and elevators. Ask your hotel about accessibility before booking.

Stick to well-lit and well-traveled routes. Avoid displaying flashy jewelry, expensive electronics, and large amounts of cash. Be aware of your surroundings at all times. If you see something suspicious or unusual contact local police to report immediately. Use added caution when shopping in crowded areas, especially during the holiday season. Use added caution when attending crowded events, celebrations, music festivals, etc. Do not leave drinks unattended in public venues as this could create a potential vulnerability for the use of “date rape” drugs in furtherance of criminal activity. Do not be predictable; vary your daily routes and schedules. Do not engage in illegal activity.

Guatemala,"Guatemala has a dedicated tourism assistance program (called PROATUR ) whose sole mission is to assist and protect foreign tourists in Guatemala. Their emergency assistance call center – staffed with Spanish and English speakers – may be contacted 24/7 by calling 1500 or +502-2290-2810. You may also contact PROATUR by WhatsApp at +502-5188-1819. Crime: Theft, armed robbery, and carjacking are the most common crimes against U.S. citizens. Travelers have experienced carjackings and armed robberies upon leaving the airport.  Victims have been violently assaulted when they resisted an attack or refused to give up money or valuables. Pickpockets and purse-snatchers are prevalent in major cities and tourist sites, especially the central market and other parts of Zone 1 in Guatemala City. In a common scenario, an accomplice distracts the victim while an assailant slashes a bag or backpack or simply steals it. Reports of sexual assault remain high. Support for victims of sexual assault is lacking. The Guatemalan border with Mexico, in particular the northwestern corner of Petén, is a high-risk area due to large scale drug and alien smuggling.  There have been instances of narco-related homicides in this area, especially along CA-13. Visitors are encouraged to fly to nearby Flores when visiting Tikal. Travelers should remain in groups, stay on principal trails leading to the Central Plaza and the Temple IV complex, and avoid remote areas of the park. Due to heightened risk of crime, U.S. Embassy personnel are not permitted to go to Zone 18 in Guatemala City, Huehuetenango Department (except the city of Huehuetenango), and San Marcos Department (except the city of San Marcos).  For more detailed information, please see the Guatemala Travel Advisory . To decrease the likelihood of becoming a victim: Be aware of your surroundings. Report any crime incidents promptly to the police. Carry a photocopy of your passport in case you lose your passport. Do not use public ATMs. Only use ATMs inside secure bank lobbies or hotels. Scams involving attempts to acquire a victim’s ATM card and personal identification number (PIN) are common. U.S. citizens have been victims of credit card scams where the card is copied and used improperly. Do not display signs of wealth, such as wearing expensive jewelry or watches. Refrain from using a cell phone on the street. A common crime against foreign citizens in Guatemala is robbery of cell phones. Do not use local public buses . U.S. Embassy personnel are not permitted to use any local buses. Avoid low-priced public inter-city buses (often recognizable as recycled and repainted U.S. school buses). Travelers also have been attacked on first-class buses on highway CA-2 near the border areas with both Mexico and El Salvador, on highways CA-1 and CA-9 near the border with El Salvador, and in the highlands between Quetzaltenango and Sololá.  Public buses are subject to frequent attacks by armed robbers, and often are poorly maintained and dangerously driven. Do not hail taxis on the street in Guatemala City, instead use radio-dispatched taxis (Taxi Amarillo), INGUAT-approved taxis from the “SAFE” stand at the Guatemala City airport, or hotel taxis. Uber is also considered safe to use in Guatemala City and Antigua. Tourist groups are advised to request security escorts. Security escorts for tourist groups are available from INGUAT and may be requested by calling 1500 or +502-2290-2800. Requests should be directed to the attention of the Coordinator of the National Tourist Assistance Program , and should provide the itinerary, names of travelers, and model and color of the vehicle in which they will be traveling. The request should be submitted by mail, fax, or e-mail , and should arrive at INGUAT at least three business days in advance of the proposed travel. INGUAT may not be able to accommodate all requests. Visit INGUAT’s web site . Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate basic medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders may encounter obstacles to accessing areas outside of major cities, and/or be unable to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . Water Safety: Basic safety measures and precautions for swimming, boating, and other outdoor activities may not be observed in Guatemala. Beware of strong currents, riptides, and undertows along Guatemala's Pacific coast beaches, as well as at Lake Atitlan.  Lifeguards are rarely present. Signs that warn of treacherous surf are rare and confined mostly to private beaches owned by hotels. Potential for Natural Disasters: There are four active volcanoes in Guatemala: Fuego, Pacaya, Tacaná, and Santiaguito. Volcanic activity has forced evacuations of nearby villages. U.S. Embassy personnel are not permitted to visit the Agua volcano due to the high incidence of robberies on the volcano. Be aware of the possibility of earthquakes at any time and make contingency plans.  Consult Guatemala’s National Seismic Institute ( INSIVUMEH ) for updates on earthquakes and seismic activity. Both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Guatemala are vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms from mid-May through November. Mudslides and flooding during the May to November rainy season often kill dozens of people and close roads. Consult Guatemala’s National Disaster Reduction Coordination Office (CONRED) for updates on natural disasters or tropical storms and hurricanes. Indigenous Areas: Be mindful of local traditional practices when visiting indigenous Maya communities as tensions can rise quickly and locals occasionally take the law into their own hands. Particularly in small villages, residents are often wary and suspicious of outsiders. Avoid activities that might unintentionally violate a cultural or religious belief. In the past, Guatemalan citizens have been lynched for suspicion of child abduction. Maintain distance from local children and refrain from actions that could fuel such suspicions.","The full range of medical care is available in Guatemala City, but medical care outside of the city is limited. Guatemala’s public hospitals frequently experience serious shortages of even the most basic medicines and equipment. Care in private hospitals is generally adequate for most common illnesses and injuries, and many of the medical specialists working in them are U.S.-trained and -certified. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of medical providers and hospitals on our website. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Many hospitals in Guatemala require payment prior to treating patients, even if personal insurance will cover the treatment. They do not typically enter into payment plan agreements, and they may decline to discharge you from the hospital if you owe money for treatment. For emergency services in Guatemala, dial 110. Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except urbanized areas. We do not pay medical bills .

Antidiscrimination laws exist, but do not include specific protections based on sexual orientation or gender identity. There is general societal discrimination against LGBTI persons in relation to their access to education, health care, employment, and housing. According to LGBTI rights groups, gay and transgender individuals often experience police abuse.  LGBTI rights groups allege that police officers regularly engage in extortion by waiting outside clubs and bars frequented by LGBTI persons to demand protection money or payment to avoid jail. A lack of trust in the judicial system and a fear of further harassment or social recrimination discourages victims from filing complaints. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Guatemala prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, , intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.  The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, information, and general infrastructure, and common in lodging and communication. There is a significant difference between Guatemala City and the rest of the country. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers .

Guinea,"Crime : Burglaries and break-ins are common, as are purse snatchings and other street robberies. Many robberies occur in taxis. Follow routine personal security considerations such as locking doors, windows, and employ security alarms. U.S. citizen employees of the Embassy are prohibited from using local taxis. Motorists have occasionally encountered improvised checkpoint barricades manned by uniformed military or police personnel who demand money and search through personal belongings, confiscating items of value. See Victims of Crime section to report incidents. Do not accept unsolicited offers of assistance at the airport or hotels as these individuals may be seeking opportunities to rob visitors of their bags, purses, or wallets. You should arrange to be met at the airport by hotel personnel or business contacts. Keep car doors locked at all times to prevent carjacking and vehicle intrusion. Only roll car windows down enough to communicate when necessary. Soldiers staffing checkpoints at night and police at intersections during the day will often solicit bribes. Display requested documents, but do not surrender them, as officials may take them if bribes are not paid. You may wish to keep a laminated copy of your documents with you that can be shown in place of your actual passports or identification cards. Demonstrations : Political tensions remain high since the 2021 military coup.  Protests around governance, utility and fuel problems, and labor disputes are common, causing disruptions to traffic and commerce.  Some prior protests have escalated into violence.  Demonstrators may attack vehicles that attempt to pass through or around the protests, resulting in serious injuries and vehicular damage. Criminals are known to take advantage of the resulting traffic congestion to rob drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Uniformed security forces may also extort drivers and passengers during these incidents. You should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings.

Guinea-Bissau,"Guinea-Bissau lacks sufficient resources and infrastructure to ensure a stable security environment. Guinea-Bissau’s instability is exacerbated by drug trafficking, as it is used as a transit point for drug shipments from Latin America. Crime : Non-violent crimes occur frequently. Law enforcement lacks the resources to respond effectively to crime. Expatriates and travelers are occasionally targeted for crimes of opportunity (petty theft, pickpocketing, theft from vehicles, minor assaults). Street criminals, aggressive vendors, and panhandlers frequently target foreigners in crowded areas and markets (particularly the popular Bandim Market) and travelers exiting the Bissau airport. According to law enforcement officials, travelers should also be cautious of the Mindara and Reino neighborhoods due to crime. The risk of being targeted by criminal actors greatly increases at night, due to Guinea-Bissau`s limited security infrastructure and lack of street and building lighting. Visitors are strongly discouraged from walking after dark, especially alone or in isolated areas. Even during daylight hours and in groups, travelers are advised to maintain a heightened level of security awareness, particularly in public places, tourist areas, and crowded locations. Corruption exists at all levels of government. Police and emergency personnel are poorly trained and lack resources to respond to crime and emergency situations effectively. Even if the police do respond to an incident, they usually lack the training and experience to conduct a proper investigation. People violating Bissau-Guinean laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or temporarily detained. All foreign visitors should carry identification (such as a certified copy of passport and/or residence permit). Narcotics trafficking is linked to criminal activity and aggressive assaults in rural areas of Guinea-Bissau. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.

Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, the availability of information, access to services and ease of movement. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, most lodging facilities, communication/information, and general infrastructure. The availability of rental, repair, or replacement parts for aids, equipment, and devices for people with disabilities, including service providers such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants, is limited, especially outside of the capital city. Women Travelers : Rape, including spousal rape, is a crime punishable by 2-6 years in prison. Domestic violence is illegal, but widespread and rarely prosecuted. Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) is against the law but is still commonly practiced, especially in the north of the country. See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."

Haiti,"Crime: Embassy employees are prohibited from using public transportation and visiting certain areas of Port-au-Prince due to high crime. Political violence and violent crimes are common in Haiti, including murders, kidnappings, robberies, assaults, vehicle break-ins, and home invasions. Travelers are often targeted, followed, and violently attacked and robbed shortly after leaving the Port-au-Prince international airport. For this reason, Embassy personnel are prohibited from traveling in personal vehicles to and from the airport. Also, the Embassy has procedures in place to detect surveillance and deter attacks on its employees. Labadee, a port near Cap Haitien in the north - only accessible by cruise ship passengers - has private security and lower rates of reported crime. Travelers should exercise heightened  precautions,however, due to increasing insecurity nationwide. Safety Precautions: Be careful about providing your destination address in Haiti. Do not provide personal information to unauthorized individuals located in the immigration, customs, or other areas inside or near any airports in Haiti. Arrange airport transfers and hotels in advance, or have your host meet you upon arrival. As you leave the airport, make sure you are not being followed. If you notice you are being followed, drive to the nearest police station immediately. Be aware of your surroundings. Keep a low profile. Do not display signs of wealth, such as jewelry or watches. Embassy employees are prohibited from visiting banks and using ATMs. U.S. citizens are often followed, attacked and robbed soon after withdrawing money. If you must use an ATM, select one that is out of sight from the general public (such as inside your hotel), and be cautious at all times. Do not resist a robbery or car-jacking attempt. Criminals may kill those who resist. If a situation makes you feel uncomfortable, leave immediately.

Honduras,"Crime: While crime and violence are serious problems throughout the country, municipalities along the north coast and central portions of the country have historically had the country’s highest crime rates. Gracias a Dios In particular, Gracias a Dios is a remote location where narcotics trafficking is commonplace, infrastructure is weak, government services are limited, and police or military presence is scarce. As a result, the U.S. Embassy has restricted U.S. government personnel travel to Gracias a Dios. U.S. citizens should not travel to Gracias a Dios. The Honduran government conducts police and military patrols in major cities in an effort to reduce crime. However, the ability of Honduran law enforcement authorities to prevent, respond to, and investigate criminal incidents, and to prosecute criminals is limited. Bay Islands and Copan Ruins Areas frequented by tourists, such as the Bay Islands (including Roatan, Utila and Guanaja) and Copan Ruins, have notably lower rates of violent crime and increased law enforcement services. U.S. government employees have no restrictions on travel to these areas. Travelers should still exercise reasonable precautions. Of note, foreign residents of the Bay Islands who purchase properties have reported increased incidents of harassment, including being the victims of violent attacks, after becoming involved in disputes. Review your personal security plans; remain aware of your surroundings and local events; and monitor local news stations for updates. Maintain a high level of vigilance, take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security, and follow instructions of local authorities. Read the Travel Advisory for Honduras for additional information. Demonstrations: Demonstrations regularly occur in Honduras, particularly near the Presidential Palace, Congress, and the universities in Tegucigalpa. Protests and work stoppages have become common at Ministerio Publico offices throughout the country, leading to interruptions in services. Additionally, some protests directed toward the U.S. government, usually small in size, can occur around the U.S. Embassy. In addition, there are often demonstrations on the CA-5, the main highway connecting Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. This highway is used to access or exit Palmerola International Airport – XPL, near Comayagua (54 miles north of Tegucigalpa). Palmerola is currently the main international airport for Tegucigalpa. Protests often result in the extended closure of major roads and highways in and between major cities, blocking the flow of goods, services and reducing access to daily household supplies. U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Honduras should avoid large gatherings or events where crowds have congregated to demonstrate, protest, or cause damage as a byproduct of celebrating an event, such as after soccer matches. Victims of Crime: If you are a victim of crime, call the national police by dialing 911. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

Individuals who attempt to bring firearms into Honduras without an appropriate permit, will face prosecution for criminal possession and possibly trafficking of firearms. Marine Safety and Oversight: Honduran military personnel commonly board private vessels in Honduran territorial waters to verify crew and passenger documentation. Criminals have been known to pose as fisherman and commit armed assaults. If your vessel is hailed by a suspicious vessel, contact the U.S. Coast Guard by radio or INMARSAT at (305) 415-6800. U.S. citizens arriving to Honduras by sea, whether by private vessel or cruise ship, are subject to the same laws as other travelers. Investment: Many U.S. firms and citizens operating in Honduras have found corruption to be a serious problem. Due to poor regulation, financial investments pose high risks and have led to substantial losses. Exercise extreme caution before investing in real estate. Fraudulent deeds are common and have led to numerous disputes. In addition, threats and violence have been used against U.S. citizens involved in property disputes. Numerous U.S. citizens have reported significant delays in resolving judicial cases and/or lack of cooperation from courts and the legal system.

Hong Kong,"Since the imposition of the National Security Law on June 30, 2020, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has demonstrated an intent to use the law to target a broad range of activities such as acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign entities. The National Security Law also covers offenses committed by non-Hong Kong SAR residents or organizations outside of the Hong Kong SAR, which could subject U.S. citizens who have been publicly critical of the PRC and/or the administration of the Hong Kong SAR to a heightened risk of arrest, detention, expulsion, or prosecution. Mainland PRC security forces, including an Office for Safeguarding National Security, now operate in Hong Kong and are not subject to oversight by the Hong Kong SAR judiciary. Drug and Alcohol Enforcement: PRC law enforcement authorities have little tolerance for illegal drugs, including marijuana and products containing cannabidiol, also known as CBD . Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs in the PRC, including Hong Kong, are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences, heavy fines, or the death penalty. Hong Kong also has strict laws against driving under the influence of alcohol that can lead to immediate detention on a criminal charge. Demonstrations: Participating in demonstrations or any other activities that authorities interpret as violating Hong Kong law, including the National Security Law, could result in criminal charges. On June 30, 2020, as part of its color-coded system of warning flags, the Hong Kong police unveiled a new purple flag, which warns protesters that shouting slogans or carrying banners with an intent prohibited by the law could now bring criminal charges. Any protests that take place without a permit are considered illegal. U.S. citizens are strongly cautioned to be aware of their surroundings and avoid demonstrations. If you decide to travel to Hong Kong: Monitor local media, local transportations sites and apps like MTR Mobile or CitybusNWFB , and the Hong Kong International Airport website for updates and traffic advisories. Avoid the areas of the demonstrations. Exercise caution if you are in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests. Avoid taking photographs of protesters or police without permission. Be aware of your surroundings. Keep a low profile. Hong Kong has a low crime rate. Even so, you should exercise caution when in congested areas and pay particular attention to personal belongings while in crowded areas and while traveling on public transportation. Violent crime, though rare, does occur. Take routine safety precautions. Report any concerns to the local police. Call “999,” the local equivalent to “911” Please note that mace, pepper spray, stun guns, bullets, switch blades, knuckle-dusters and other self-protection weapons are banned in Hong Kong. Do not buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are the bootlegs illegal in the United States, but, if you purchase them, you may also be breaking local law. You may also pay fines or must give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Be alert to criminal schemes, such as internet, phone scams and dating scams, as well as financial scams. See the U.S. Department of State's and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s pages for information on scams.

India,"U.S. citizens should always practice good personal security and situational awareness. Be aware of your surroundings. This includes local customs and etiquette. Keep a low profile. Monitor local news reports, vary routes and times in carrying out daily activities, and consider the level of security present when visiting public places, including religious sites, and when choosing hotels, restaurants, and entertainment and recreation venues. India intermittently experiences terrorist and insurgent activities which may affect U.S. citizens directly or indirectly. Some U.S.-designated terrorist groups are active in India, including Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e Tayyiba. The U.S. government occasionally receives information regarding possible terrorist attacks that could take place in India, monitors such information to determine credibility, and advises U.S. citizens accordingly. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive messages from the Embassy automatically. Past attacks have targeted public places, including some frequented by Westerners, such as luxury and other hotels, trains, train stations, markets, cinemas, mosques, and restaurants in large urban areas. Attacks have taken place during the busy evening hours in markets and other crowded places but could occur at any time. Alerts are usually more frequent around major holidays. The Maoists (also known as “Naxalites”) are the most active insurgent group in India. The Naxalites typically attack Indian government officials, but have also derailed trains, targeted other government buildings such as police stations, and conducted other criminal activity. Demonstrations and general strikes, or “bandh,” often cause major inconvenience and unrest. These strikes can result in the stoppage of all transportation and tourist-related services, at times for 24 hours or more. U.S. citizens caught in such a strike may find they are unable to make flight and rail connections, as local transportation can be severely limited. Local media generally give an idea of the length and geographical location of the strike. You are urged to obey any imposed curfews and travel restrictions and avoid demonstrations and rallies as they have the potential for violence, especially immediately preceding and following political rallies, elections, and religious festivals (particularly when Hindu and Muslim festivals coincide). Tensions between castes and religious groups can also result in disruptions and violence. There are active ""anti-conversion"" laws in some Indian states, and acts of conversion sometimes elicit violent reactions from Hindu extremists. Foreigners suspected of proselytizing Hindus have been attacked and killed in conservative, rural areas in India in years past. In some cases, demonstrators specifically block roads near popular tourist sites and disrupt train operations in order to gain the attention of Indian authorities; occasionally vehicles transporting tourists are attacked in these incidents. You should monitor local television, print and social media, and Mission India’s American Citizens Services Facebook page Swimming: You should exercise caution if you intend to swim in open waters along the Indian coastline, particularly during the monsoon season. Every year, people in Goa, Mumbai, Puri (Odisha), off the Eastern Coast in the Bay of Bengal, and other areas drown due to strong undertows. It is important to heed warnings posted at beaches and to avoid swimming in the ocean during the monsoon season. Several years ago, there were reports of fatal crocodile attacks in the Andaman Islands. Trained lifeguards are very rare along beaches. Wildlife Safaris: Many tour operators and lodges advertise structured, safe excursions into parks and other wildlife viewing areas for close observation of flora and fauna. However, safety standards and training vary, and it is advisable to ascertain whether operators are trained and licensed. Even animals marketed as “tame” should be respected as wild and extremely dangerous. Keep a safe distance from animals at all times, remaining in vehicles or other protected enclosures when venturing into game parks or safaris. Trekking: Trekking expeditions should be limited to routes identified for this purpose by local authorities. Use only registered trekking agencies, porters, and guides, suspend trekking after dark, camp at designated camping places, and travel in groups rather than individually. Altitudes in popular trekking spots can exceed 25,000 feet (7,620 m); please ensure you are fit to trek at these altitudes and carry sufficient medical insurance that includes medical evacuation coverage. Train Travel: India has the third largest rail network in the world, and train travel in India is generally safe. Nevertheless, accidents and on-board fires are sometimes caused by aging infrastructure, poorly maintained equipment, overcrowding, and operator errors. Train accidents and fires have resulted in death and serious injury of passengers. Areas of Instability: Jammu & Kashmir: The Department of State recommends that you do not travel to the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir because of the potential for terrorist incidents as well as violent public unrest. A number of terrorist groups operate in the territory targeting security forces, particularly along the Line of Control (LOC) separating Indian and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, and those stationed in primary tourist destinations in the Kashmir Valley: Srinagar, Gulmarg, and Pahalgam. Foreigners are particularly visible, vulnerable, and at risk. In the past, serious communal violence left the territory mostly paralyzed due to massive strikes and business shutdowns, and U.S. citizens have had to be evacuated by local police. The Indian government prohibits foreign tourists from visiting certain areas along the LOC (see the section on Restricted Areas, below) and may require a travel permit to enter this area. India-Pakistan Border: The Department of State recommends that you do not travel to areas within ten kilometers of the border between India and Pakistan. Both India and Pakistan maintain a strong military presence on both sides of the border. The only official India-Pakistan border crossing point for persons who are not citizens of India or Pakistan is in the state of Punjab between Atari, India, and Wagah, Pakistan. The border crossing is usually open, but you are advised to confirm the current status of the border crossing prior to commencing travel. A Pakistani visa is required to enter Pakistan. Only U.S. citizens residing in India may apply for a Pakistani visa in India. Otherwise, you should apply for a Pakistani visa in your country of residence before traveling to India. Both India and Pakistan claim an area of the Karakoram Mountain range that includes the Siachen glacier. Travel or mountain climbing in this area is highly dangerous. The disputed area includes the following peaks: Rimo Peak; Apsarasas I, II, and III; Tegam Kangri I, II and III; Suingri Kangri; Ghiant I and II; Indira Col; and Sia Kangri. Check with the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi for information on current conditions. Northeastern States: Incidents of violence by ethnic insurgent groups, including bombings of buses, trains, rail lines, and markets, occur sporadically in the northeast. While U.S. citizens have not been specifically targeted, it is possible that you could be affected as a bystander. If you travel to the northeast, you should avoid travel by train at night, travel outside major cities at night, and crowds. U.S. government employees at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in India are prohibited from traveling to certain areas in the states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Manipur without permission from the U.S. Consulate General in Kolkata. Restricted Area Permits are required for foreigners to visit certain Northeastern states (see the section on Restricted Areas, below.) Contact the U.S. Consulate General in Kolkata for information on current conditions. East Central and Southern India: Maoist extremist groups, or “Naxalites,” are active in East Central India, primarily in rural areas. The Naxalites have a long history of conflict with state and national authorities, including frequent terrorist attacks on local police, paramilitary forces, and government officials, and are responsible for more attacks in the country than any other organization through an ongoing campaign of violence and intimidation. Naxalites have not specifically targeted U.S. citizens but have attacked symbolic targets that have included Western companies and rail lines. While Naxalite violence does not normally occur in places frequented by foreigners, there is a risk that visitors could become victims of violence. Naxalites are active in a large swath of India from eastern Maharashtra and northern Telangana through western West Bengal, particularly in rural parts of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and on the borders of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Odisha. Due to the fluid nature of the threat, all U.S. government travelers to states with Naxalite activity must receive authorization from the U.S. Consulate responsible for the area to be visited, unless they are only visiting capital cities. Restricted/Protected areas: Certain states or portions of states require Restricted Area Permits. These include: The state of Arunachal Pradesh Portions of the state of Sikkim Portions of the state of Himachal Pradesh near the Chinese border Portions of the state of Uttarakhand (Uttaranchal) near the Chinese border Portions of the state of Rajasthan near the Pakistani border Portions of the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir near the Line of Control with Pakistan and certain portions of the union territory of Ladakh The union territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands The union territory of the Laccadives Islands (Lakshadweep) Portions of the state of Manipur Portions of the state of Mizoram Portions of the state of Nagaland More information about travel to/in restricted/protected areas can be found from India’s Bureau of Immigration . Restricted Area Permits are available outside India at Indian embassies and consulates abroad, or in India from the Ministry of Home Affairs (Foreigners Division) at Jaisalmer House, 26 Man Singh Road, New Delhi. The states of Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim maintain official guesthouses in New Delhi, which can also issue Restricted Area Permits for their respective states for certain travelers. While visiting Mamallapuram (Mahabalipuram) in Tamil Nadu, you should be aware that the Indira Gandhi Atomic Research Center in Kalpakkam is located just south of the site and is not clearly marked as a restricted and dangerous area. For the latest security information, travelers should enroll in STEP to receive updated security information and regularly monitor travel information available from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi as well as the U.S. Consulates General in Mumbai , Chennai , Hyderabad , and Kolkata . Crime: Violent crime, especially directed against foreigners, has traditionally been uncommon. Petty crime, especially theft of personal property (including U.S. passports), is common, particularly on trains or buses, at airports, and in major tourist areas. Pickpockets can be very skilled and travelers have reported having their bags snatched, purse-straps cut, or the bottom of their purses slit without their knowledge. If traveling by train, lock your sleeping compartments and take your valuables with you when leaving your berth. If you travel by air, be careful with your bags in the arrival and departure areas outside airports. Be cautious about displaying cash or expensive items to reduce the chance of being a target for robbery or other crime, and be aware of your surroundings when you use ATMs. Scammers have used ATM card scams to clone credit card details and withdraw money. Individuals have reported cases of sexual assault, including rape, against U.S. citizens traveling throughout India. The U.S. government cautions citizens, especially women, not to travel alone in India. Please observe stringent security precautions. When traveling without known and trustworthy companions, use public transport specifically designated for “women-only” travelers, which is a free service offered by the Indian government in many metropolitan cities including Delhi and Hyderabad. Please restrict evening entertainment to well-known venues and avoid isolated areas when traveling alone at any time of the day. Keep your hotel room number confidential and make sure hotel room doors have chains, deadlocks, and peep holes. Travel with groups of friends rather than alone. In addition, only hire reliable cars and drivers and avoid traveling alone in hired taxis, especially at night. Use taxis from hotels and pre-paid taxis at airports rather than hailing them on the street. If you encounter threatening situations, call “100” for police assistance (“112” from mobile phones). If you use app-based services like “Uber” or “Ola” share your ride information with a friend. Travelers in India are advised to respect local dress and customs. Indian women typically wear conservative everyday dress. This is the norm throughout the country, and even more so in rural areas. They wear clothing that covers their legs and shoulders. Exceptions are vacation resorts catering to foreign clientele and some neighborhoods of major cities like New Delhi and Mumbai. Western women, especially those of African descent, continue to report incidents of verbal and physical harassment by individuals and groups of men. Known locally as “Eve-teasing,” these incidents of sexual harassment can be quite frightening and quickly cross the line from verbal to physical. Sexual harassment can occur anytime or anywhere, but most frequently has happened in crowded areas such as in marketplaces, train stations, buses, and public streets. The harassment can range from sexually suggestive or lewd comments to catcalls to outright groping. The Government of India has focused more on addressing gender-based violence. One outcome has been more reports of sexual assault nationwide. Indian authorities report rape is one of India's fastest growing crimes. If you find yourself in a life-threatening situation, you should call the police immediately and follow up with a call to the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. We can sometimes connect you with an Indian non-governmental organization that may be able to provide assistance. Please review our travel tips for Women Travelers . If you are victimized overseas, you may be entitled to receive compensation for counseling and/or other services such as relocation back to the United States. For further information, visit the U.S. Department of Justice page for violence against women. Scams are common at major airports, train stations, popular restaurants, and tourist sites. Scam artists prey on visitors by creating distractions. Be careful of taxi drivers and others. This includes train porters. They solicit travelers with ""come-on"" offers of cheap transportation and/or hotels. Travelers who accept such offers are often the victims of scams. These include offers to help with ""necessary"" transfers to the domestic airport, overpriced hotel rooms, unwanted ""tours,"" unwelcome ""purchases,"" long cab rides, and even threats when the tourists decline to pay. Tourists have reported being lured and extorted for money in the face of threats of violence against the traveler and his/her family members. Be careful when hiring transportation and guides. Use only well-known travel agents to book trips. Some vendors sell carpets, jewelry, and gemstones. These items may be expensive and not of the promised quality. Deal only with reputable businesses and do not hand over your credit cards or money unless you are certain that goods being shipped are the goods you purchased. If a deal sounds too good to be true, it is best avoided. Most Indian states have official tourism bureaus set up to handle complaints. Do not agree to transport any goods on behalf of strangers in exchange for money. India-based criminals use the internet to extort money from victims abroad. In a common scam, the victim develops a close romantic relationship with an alleged U.S. citizen they meet online. When the “friend” travels to India, a series of accidents occur and the victim begins to receive requests for financial assistance, sometimes through an intermediary. In fact, the U.S. citizen “friend” does not exist; they are only online personas used by criminal networks. Victims have been defrauded of thousands of dollars in these schemes. Do not send money to anyone you have not met in person and carefully read the Department of State’s advice on international financial scams . In another common scam, family members in the United States, especially older people, are asked for money. The scammers claim to be grandchildren or relatives who have been arrested or are without money to return home. Do not send money without contacting the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General to confirm the other party’s situation. You can also call our Office of Overseas Citizens Services at 888-407-4747 (from overseas: 202-501-4444). Review our information on emergency assistance to Americans abroad. U.S. citizens have had problems with business partners, usually involving property investments. You may wish to seek professional legal advice in reviewing any contracts for business or services offered in India. The U.S. Embassy and consulates cannot give legal advice. They also cannot help U.S. citizens with Indian courts on civil or criminal matters. A list of local attorneys is available on the Embassy and Consulates General websites . See the Department of State and the FBI pages for more information on scams. Don’t buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are the bootlegs illegal in the United States, if you purchase them you may also be breaking local law. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the local police, then inform the U.S. Embassy or local Consulate. Report crimes to the local police by calling “100” or “112” from a mobile phone. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: help you find appropriate medical care assist you in reporting a crime to the police contact relatives or friends with your written consent explain the local criminal justice process in general terms provide a list of local attorneys provide information on victims’ compensation programs in the U.S. provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution help you find accommodation and arrange flights home replace a stolen or lost passport You should ask for a copy of the police report, known as a “First Information Report” (FIR), from local police when you report an incident. Local authorities generally can't act without a police report. If your passport is stolen, report the theft or loss right away. Report it to the police in the place where your passport was stolen. You need an FIR to get an exit visa to leave India. The Indian government requires it if the lost passport had your Indian visa. Although the Embassy or Consulate General is able to replace a stolen or lost passport, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) are responsible for approving an exit permit. This process usually takes three to four working days but can take longer. In cases of sexual assault or rape, the Embassy or Consulates General can provide a list of local doctors and hospitals, if needed, to discuss treatment and prevention options for diseases and pregnancy. You should be aware that for evidence of an assault to be submitted in a court case, Indian authorities require that the medical exam be completed at a government hospital. Therefore, if a victim goes to a private hospital for treatment, the hospital will refer them to a government hospital for this aspect of the medical process. India has many resources for victims of rape and sexual assault. The specific toll-free Women’s Helpline Service number in Delhi is 1091; in Mumbai it is 103; in Kolkata, 1090; in Chennai, 1091 or 2345-2365; and in Hyderabad 1098. The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in India is “100.” An additional emergency number, “112,” can be accessed from mobile phones. Please see our information for victims of crime , including possible victim compensation programs in the United States. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or Consulates for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.","For emergency services in India, dial 112 from a cell phone; from a land line, dial 100 for police, 102 for ambulance (108 in parts of South India), and 101 for fire. Ambulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment, and traffic does not yield to emergency vehicles. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. Most hospitals require advance payment or confirmation of insurance prior to treatment. Payment practices vary, and credit cards are not routinely accepted for medical care. Zika, dengue, malaria, measles, and other diseases are present in India. See the Center for Disease Control’s website for more information. The quality of medical care in India varies considerably. Medical care in the major population centers approaches and occasionally meets Western standards, but adequate medical care is usually very limited or unavailable in rural areas. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Make sure your health insurance covers care overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of India to ensure the medication is legal in India. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Pharmaceuticals: Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with limited controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. When buying medication, consult with a medical professional and purchase from reputable establishments. Please visit the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention website on counterfeit drugs for more information. Water Quality: Water is a common vehicle for the transmission of disease. Impure drinking water can transmit serious diseases such as typhoid, cholera, hepatitis, and dysentery. You can make water safe for drinking by filtering/boiling, distilling, or using chemicals. Bottled water is generally safe for consumption. It is best to stick to the major brands. The water bottle seal or cap should be intact. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If you are arriving in India from Sub-Saharan Africa or other areas with yellow-fever risk, Indian health regulations require that you present evidence of vaccination against yellow fever. If you lack such proof, authorities may immediately deport you or detain you in the yellow-fever quarantine center for six days. If you travel through any part of sub-Saharan Africa, even for one day, health authorities advise you to carry proof of yellow fever immunization. Dogs and bats create a high risk of rabies transmission in most of India. Health authorities recommend vaccination for all prolonged stays, especially for young children and travelers in rural areas. It is also recommended for shorter stays that involve occupational exposure, locations more than 24 hours from a reliable source of human rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine for post-exposure treatment, adventure travelers, hikers, cave explorers, and backpackers. Monkeys also can transmit rabies and herpes B, among other diseases, to human victims. Avoid feeding monkeys. If bitten, you should immediately soak and scrub the bite for at least 15 minutes and seek urgent medical attention. Influenza transmission occurs from November to April in areas north of the Tropic of Cancer (north India) and from June through November (the rainy season) in areas south of the Tropic of Cancer (south India), with a smaller peak from February through April; off-season transmission can also occur. All travelers are at risk. During the flu season, health authorities recommend that all travelers get the influenza vaccine. Outbreaks of avian influenza (H5N1 virus) occur intermittently in eastern India, including West Bengal, Manipur, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Assam. Malaria risk depends on time of year and area the traveler is visiting. Please consult the CDC website for India for more information. Dengue fever presents significant risk in urban and rural areas. Health officials report the highest number of cases from July to December, with cases peaking from September to October. The CDC recommends taking daytime insect precautions, such as wearing long-sleeved shirts and mosquito repellent. Tuberculosis is an increasingly serious health concern in India. Please visit the CDC website or more information. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in India, and you should consult your doctor prior to travel and consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. The air quality in India varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the winter. Anyone who travels where pollution levels are high is at risk. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens People over 65 years of age People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema People with heart disease or diabetes People who work or are active outdoors Current air quality data can be found on the Department of State’s air quality page . The data on this site are updated hourly. Rh-negative blood may be difficult to obtain as it is not common in Asia. Medical Tourism: Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. Companies offering vacation packages bundled with medical consultations and financing options provide direct-to-consumer advertising over the internet. Such medical packages often claim to provide high quality care, but the quality of health care in India is highly variable. People seeking health care in India should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and refer to the information from the CDC . Persons traveling to India for medical purposes require the proper “medical” visa. Please check with the nearest Indian embassy or consulate for more information. Despite reports of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitals, in general travelers should not delay or avoid treatment for urgent or emergent medical situations. However, health tourists and other travelers who may be contemplating elective procedures in this country should carefully research individual hospital infection control practices. Surrogacy: Commercial surrogacy is illegal for foreigners in India, subject to complex local regulation. For additional information, visit the Government of India’s official information on foreigner surrogacy . The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General in India maintain lists of local doctors and hospitals, all of which are published on their respective websites under ""U.S. Citizen Services."" We cannot endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. You may face arrest, imprisonment, and/or deportation if you violate local laws, even unknowingly. Furthermore, some activities are crimes under U.S. law and can be prosecuted in the U.S. regardless of whether they are allowed under local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. If police or prison officials arrest or detain you, immediately ask them to notify the U.S. Embassy. See our webpage for further information. Alcohol: Each of India’s states has its own rules for buying and drinking alcohol. Legal drinking ages range from 18 to 25 and can vary by beverage type. Some states permit alcohol use for medicinal purposes only while others require you to hold a permit to buy, transport, or consume alcohol. Penalties for violation can be harsh. Several U.S. citizens at Indian airports have been arrested for attempting to smuggle illegal drugs from India. Many claim that they did not realize they were carrying narcotics. Never transport or mail packages that do not belong to you and maintain direct control of your luggage at all times. Beef and Cow Hide: Several states in India impose various types of prohibition on beef. In some rural areas, cow protection vigilantes have attacked people they suspected of selling or consuming beef, or possessing items made with cow hide. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES: Dual Nationality: India does not permit its citizens to hold dual nationality. In 2006, India launched the ""Overseas Citizens of India"" (OCI) program, which does not grant Indian citizenship but is similar to a U.S. ""green card"" in that you can travel to and from India indefinitely, work in India, study in India, and own property in India (except for certain agricultural and plantation properties). If you are a U.S. citizen and obtain an OCI card you will not become a citizen of India; you will remain a citizen of the United States. An OCI card holder does not receive an Indian passport, cannot vote in Indian elections, and is not eligible for Indian government employment. U.S. citizens of Indian descent can apply for OCI cards at the Indian Embassy in Washington or at the Indian Consulates in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Houston. Inside India, U.S. citizens can apply at the nearest FRRO office (please see “Entry/Exit Requirements” section above for more information on the FRRO). U.S. citizens must use a U.S. passport when traveling in and out of the United States. Faith-based travelers and those participating in religious activities should refer to the Department of State's Report on International Religious Freedom. Indian law mandates that individuals engaging in religious proselytizing obtain a ""missionary"" visa. Immigration authorities have determined that engaging in certain activities, such as speaking at religious meetings open to the general public, could violate immigration law if the traveler does not possess a missionary visa. Foreigners with tourist visas who engage in missionary activity are subject to deportation and possible criminal prosecution. The states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Arunachal Pradesh have legislation that regulates or places restrictions on conversion from one religion to another. If you plan to engage in missionary activity, you may want to seek legal advice to find out if Indian law permits the activities you plan to pursue. Tourists should also mind restrictions and observances when planning to visit any religious establishment. These include Hindu temples, mosques, churches, and other sacred places to the local population. Many individual temples and mosques do not permit non-members to enter all or parts of the facilities, and may require the removal of shoes, the covering of the head, or have other specific requirements for appropriate attire. Customs rules are strict. Before traveling to or from India, inspect all bags and clothes well. Make sure they do not contain banned items. Airport security officials have arrested or detained several U.S. citizens after discovering loose ammunition (including spent individual bullets and casings) or weapons in their luggage. If authorities find loose ammunition or bullets (including empty bullet shells used in souvenirs) on your person or in your bags, they will charge you with violating the Indian Arms Act, and may incarcerate or deport you from India. Additionally, Indian authorities have arrested and prosecuted U.S. citizens for possessing satellite phones, which is strictly prohibited in India. Indian customs authorities enforce strict regulations. They cover temporary importation into or export from India of items like antiquities, electronics, currency, ivory, gold objects, and other banned materials. You need permission from the Government of India to bring in restricted items, even if you are only transiting through India. If you do not comply with these regulations, you risk arrest or fine or both and confiscation of these items. If Indian law enforcement charges you with any legal violations, make sure to have an attorney review any document before signing it. The Government of India requires the registration of antique items with the local police along with a photograph of the item. It is advisable to contact the Embassy of India in Washington or one of India's consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements. More information is available from the Indian Central Board of Excise and Customs. Indian customs authorities encourage the use of an ATA (Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission) Carnet for the temporary admission of professional equipment, commercial samples, and/or goods for exhibitions and fair purposes. ATA Carnet Headquarters, located at the U.S. Council for International Business , 1212 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036, issues and guarantees the ATA Carnet in the United States. For additional information call (212) 354-4480, or email USCIB for details. Please see our section on Customs Information for more information. Natural Disaster Threats: Parts of northern India are highly susceptible to earthquakes. Regions of highest risk, ranked 5 on a scale of 1 to 5, include areas around Srinagar, Himachal Pradesh, Rishikesh and Dehradun, the northern parts of Punjab, northwest Gujarat, northern Bihar, and the entire northeast. Ranked 4 (high damage risk) is an area that sweeps along the north through Jammu and Kashmir, Eastern Punjab, Haryana, Northern Uttar Pradesh, central Bihar and the northern parts of West Bengal. New Delhi is located in zone 4. Severe flooding is common in hilly and mountainous areas throughout India. Flooding in 2013 in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and other areas left thousands of people presumed dead and temporarily stranded dozens of U.S. citizens. Typhoons/cyclones and subsequent flooding are common along the Indian coasts, in particular the Eastern coastal states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal, and have at times resulted in massive loss of life. Tourists and residents in areas prone to these events should remain vigilant during severe weather, monitor local media for latest developments, and heed all municipal warnings. Residents in these areas should have contingency plans for loss of power and unavailability of goods and services, including supplies for multiple days after a severe weather event. Accessibility: Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation in India very different than what you find in the United States. Despite legislation that all public buildings and transport be accessible for disabled people, accessibility remains limited. One notable exception is the Delhi metro system, designed to be accessible to those with physical disabilities. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips. LGBTQI+ Travelers: The Supreme Court of India decriminalized same-sex relationships in 2018. Since then, state and union governments have been directed to develop reforms that protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons, including efforts to provide gender neutral bathrooms at schools and colleges and separate housing for gender-nonconforming and transgender persons in prison. Although Indian law prohibits discrimination by state and nonstate actors based on sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics, the government is inconsistent in implementing and enforcing these laws, and reports of widespread discrimination, harassment, threats, and violence against LGBTQI+ persons, particularly in rural areas or by local police, persist. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details."
Indonesia,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Extremists in Indonesia aspire to carry out violent attacks against Indonesian and foreign targets, and police have arrested more than 1,200 individuals on terrorism-related charges since 2018. Extremists may target both official and private establishments, including government offices, hotels, bars, nightclubs, shopping areas, restaurants, and places of worship. Be aware of your personal safety and security at all times. Recent incidents of extremist violence include a December 2022 suicide bombing at a police station in Bandung, West Java that killed one police officer, a March 2021 bomb attack against a church in Makassar, South Sulawesi which injured 20 civilians, and May 2018 bomb attacks against three churches in Surabaya, East Java which killed 15 civilians and injured 50. Demonstrations are very common in Jakarta, Surabaya, and other large cities, but less common in Bali. You should avoid demonstrations and other mass gatherings, since even those intended to be peaceful can become violent. U.S. citizens have been detained for participating in protests.  Demonstrations may become more frequent ahead of the Indonesian general elections scheduled for February 2024. Currently, travel by U.S. government personnel to the provinces of Central Papua (Papua Tengah) and Highland Papua (Papua Pegunungan) is restricted to mission-essential travel that is approved in advance by the Embassy. Papuan separatists have kidnapped foreigners in the past and a New Zealand national was kidnapped by a separatist group in Nduga Regency in February 2023. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: In the last year several American citizens were victims of violent and serious crimes in Indonesia, particularly in Bali. As with any major tourist destination, U.S. citizens traveling in Indonesia are especially encouraged to always remain vigilant of their surroundings and read the following advisories carefully. Take sensible measures to protect yourself and your belongings.  Closely monitor bags and luggage and carry only essential items. Take particular care of your passport and bank cards and avoid traveling alone. Police presence and responsiveness is less than it is in the United States, making it more difficult to report crimes quickly and receive police attention. U.S. citizens often cite language barriers as a major hindrance when reporting crimes. Pickpocketing, sexual assault, vehicle theft, armed car-jacking, snatch and grab robberies of cell phones and purses, and residential break-ins are common. Avoid traveling to isolated areas late at night. Be aware of your surroundings, particularly vehicles or individuals that might be following you. Use a reputable taxi company or hire a taxi either at a major hotel or shopping center and ensure the driver’s identity card is visible. If you are booking a car via a mobile app, always ensure that the driver is the same as the person on the app, share your journey with a friend via the in-app option, and know the contact information for the app’s security center. Be aware of drivers falsely claiming to be registered with online ride hailing apps. Credit card fraud is a common problem in Indonesia. Criminals have “skimmed” credit/debit cards to access and drain bank accounts. Use an ATM in a secure location, such as a major bank branch, and check the machine for evidence of tampering. Monitor your account statements regularly. Tourists and Indonesians have suffered from serious illness and have even died from ""drink-spiking” and drink poisoning incidents, particularly in clubs and nightspots in urban and tourist areas. There have been reports of sexual assaults and drink spiking in Bali, Lombok, and the Gili Islands.  Make sure drinks are prepared in your sight and be careful about accepting drinks from strangers at clubs and parties or leaving drinks unattended. Tourists have also been robbed after taking visitors to their hotel rooms, and in some cases have found that their drinks were spiked. There have also been deaths and serious illnesses caused by drinking alcoholic drinks contaminated with methanol. These cases have occurred in bars, shops, and hotels in popular tourist areas like Bali, Lombok, the Gili Islands, and Sumatra. Sexual Assault: Women travelling alone may be subject to harassment and verbal abuse. Sexual assault, harassment, and rape occur. To minimize the risk, avoid travelling alone, especially at night; remain particularly vigilant in less populous areas; and be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Local authorities may not respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment. If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to local authorities and to the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Participating in demonstrations on a tourist visa can lead to deportation. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams occur in Indonesia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Victims of Crime: Sexual assault: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should seek prompt medical assistance, contact the Embassy or nearest Consulate, and call the local police at 112. For a criminal investigation to be initiated by the police, the victim must make a full statement to the local police, in person.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault may choose to be accompanied by a translator. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Explain the local criminal justice process in general terms Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution. Follow this link for more information Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism and recreational activity industries are unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  Water sports, especially diving, can be hazardous in Indonesia with operators lightly regulated and hyperbaric chambers available only in Bali and Ambon.  Traffic is hazardous in Indonesia and U.S. citizens are frequently injured while riding rented motorbikes. Wearing a helmet is required by law. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities, and only basic stabilization may be available. Serious injuries require medical evacuation to another country. First responders are generally unable to provide urgent medical treatment or to access areas outside of major cities. Boat and ferry incidents are frequent; vessels rarely carry appropriate sizes and numbers of safety vests; passengers are encouraged to bring their own. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage ( http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html ). Please note: The U.S. Embassy and Consulates do not pay the medical expenses of private U.S. citizens in Indonesia. It is the traveler’s responsibility to ensure adequate medical insurance coverage or funds for medical expenses.","The Government of Indonesia requires all non-Indonesian citizens entering the country to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Medical Care: For emergency services in Indonesia dial 112. Sanitation and health care conditions in Indonesia are far below U.S. standards. Routine medical care is available in all major cities, although most expatriates leave the country for all but the most basic medical procedures. Physicians and hospitals often expect payment or sizable deposits before providing medical care, even in emergency and/or life-threatening situations. See our Embassy's website for a list of English-speaking doctors and hospitals, but keep in mind that even in large cities the quality of English-speaking medical personnel will vary and there are often communication difficulties. In remote areas there may be no English-speaking medical personnel. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions. Ambulance services are not widely available, and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Ambulances are not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation, which can exceed over $100,000 per person. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Be aware that Indonesian authorities may consider some prescription drugs as illegal narcotics. The Indonesian government does not publish a list of which pharmaceuticals are considered contraband, and these decisions may be arbitrary. U.S. citizens are advised against mailing or shipping by courier any medications to Indonesia. Indonesian authorities pay close attention to packages containing pharmaceuticals and may detain or arrest recipients of both prescription and over the counter medications. Even if a medication is legal or has been prescribed in the United States, it may be considered an illegal narcotic in Indonesia. U.S. citizens are advised to only hand carry prescription medications into the country, in the original packaging with a copy of any prescription. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates cannot assist you with the importation and/or release of medications. Marijuana, Cannabis, hash, “edibles,” and products containing CBD or THC remain illegal in Indonesia, including for medicinal purposes.  A medical prescription does not make it legal. Local pharmacies carry a range of products of variable quality, availability, and cost. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals are a significant risk; patronize only reputable pharmacies. Malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and Zika virus are mosquito borne diseases in Indonesia. Prevention of mosquito bites is strongly encouraged; malaria preventive medication is needed in some areas. Pregnant women should be aware that Indonesia is a CDC Zika risk area and that Zika can be spread by mosquitos as well as sexual contact . Diarrheal diseases are very common throughout Indonesia and food and water precautions are recommended. Rabies is prevalent in animals and animal contact should be avoided. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Air Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. See the OPTIONAL stock language below for additional suggestions. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Indonesia. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Indonesia. Pharmaceuticals Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas.  Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients.  Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Water Quality Tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Adventure Travel Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel . General Health Language The following diseases are prevalent: Tuberculosis Dengue Chikungunya Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in Indonesia. Air Quality Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Indonesia. Consider the impact smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens People over 65 years of age People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema People with heart disease or diabetes People who work or are active outdoors","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to Indonesian laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Criminal cases can take months or even years to resolve, and suspects can be held without charges for up to 60 days, and in many cases longer. Indonesia‘s revised criminal code, which takes effect January 2026, includes penalties for defamation, blasphemy, cohabitation, and sex outside of marriage. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to stay up-to-date. If you are convicted of possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs in Indonesia, you may be subject to heavy fines, long jail sentences, and even the death penalty. Some prescription medications that are available in the United States are illegal in Indonesia. Some drugs used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are illegal in Indonesia. Marijuana, Cannabis, hash, “edibles,” and products containing CBD or THC remain illegal in Indonesia, including for medicinal purposes. A medical prescription does not make it legal. If you take such products to Indonesia or purchase or use them in Indonesia, you can be arrested and face imprisonment, fines, deportation, or the death penalty. Illegal drug convictions often result in lengthy prison sentences, even at the simple possession level. Indonesian prison conditions are harsh and do not meet U.S. standards. Many prisons are overcrowded and provide minimal services. The costs of basic services, including healthcare, often must be borne by the prisoner. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information nternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: LGBTQI+ status or conduct is not illegal, but local authorities sometimes take legal action against, or tolerate harassment of people engaging in LGBTQI+ relationships or openly expressing LGBTQI+ identity. Some local governments have passed laws criminalizing LGBTQI+ relationships. Same-sex marriages or civil unions recognized as valid in other countries are not legally recognized in Indonesia. The Indonesian Parliament revised the criminal code to include penalties for cohabitation and sex outside of marriage. These revisions, however, will not come into force until January 2026, and how they will be implemented is unclear. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details . Sharia Law: Sharia law is enforced in Aceh province and may exist unofficially or through local legislation in other areas. The law is intended for Muslims and should not apply to non-Muslims or foreign visitors. You should be respectful of local traditions, mindful of social norms, and seek guidance from local police if confronted by Sharia authorities. Earthquakes and Tsunamis: There are approximately 4,000 earthquakes per year in Indonesia, or more than 10 per day on average. While most earthquakes are mild, some cause significant destruction and can trigger tsunamis. Tsunami warning systems may not be operable, or reports of tremors and tsunamis may be delayed. Local construction standards are lower than in the United States, and many structures including hotels and malls are prone to damage or collapse in an earthquake. Access to disaster-affected areas is often difficult and assistance from the U.S. Embassy may be limited. If a major earthquake or landslide occurs close to shore, you should follow the instructions of local authorities, bearing in mind that a tsunami could arrive within minutes. The Indonesia Tsunami Early Warning Centre issues tsunami warnings when a potential tsunami with significant impact is imminent or expected. Volcanoes: There are 127 active volcanoes in Indonesia. Eruptions frequently cause travel delays, displace local populations, and disrupt economic activities. Environmental Quality: Air quality in Indonesia’s major cities can range from ""unhealthy for sensitive groups"" to ""unhealthy."" Current air quality data for Jakarta can be found on the Embassy’s Air Quality page. Tap water is not potable throughout Indonesia and should not be consumed. Mountain Hiking: When hiking in mountainous areas, obtain current information on local conditions, travel with a reputable guide, have overseas medical insurance, and carry a local mobile phone. Never go hiking or climbing alone. Particularly dangerous trails may not be clearly labeled as such. Hikers on Puncak Jaya in Papua should have realistic primary and backup plans for climbing down the mountain. Tour operators have abandoned climbers. Taking shortcuts through private property is considered trespassing and is not a safe or legal alternative to a proper plan. If possible, ensure your hiking plans are registered and known to local authorities and/or tourism operators, as this helps identify your presence in these areas in the event of an emergency. Dual Nationality: Indonesian law does not recognize dual nationality for adults over 18 years of age. U.S. citizens who are also Indonesian nationals may be required to renounce their Indonesian citizenship and may also be deported. Please visit our Dual Nationality page . Travelers with Disabilities: Persons with disabilities will face severe difficulties in Indonesia as most public places and transportation facilities do not accommodate disabled people. The law in Indonesia prohibits discrimination against persons with mental and physical disabilities, but the law is seldom enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be extremely limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: Women traveling alone may be subject to harassment and verbal abuse. Sexual assault, harassment, and rape occur. To minimize the risk, avoid travelling alone, especially at night; remain particularly vigilant in less populous areas; and be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. While domestic violence is illegal in Indonesia, these laws are rarely enforced. Local authorities may not respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment. If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to local authorities and to the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General and seek medical attention. See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Iran,"As noted in the Travel Advisory for Iran, U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Iran face a significant threat of kidnapping or arrest and detention on spurious charges. U.S. citizens who travel to Iran despite the Travel Advisory should exercise caution throughout the country, but especially in the southeastern region where foreigners have been victims of criminal gangs. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to areas within 100 kilometers of the border with Afghanistan, near the Iraq border, and generally anywhere east of the line from Bam and Bandar Abbas toward the Pakistani border. Terrorism: In Iran, there is potential for death or injury because of terrorist attacks. Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Iran. ISIS and affiliated groups have claimed responsibility for bombings and other attacks in Iran. The threat of terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury to bystanders. Additionally, Iran is a designated state-sponsor of terrorism. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Foreigners occasionally become victims of petty street crime, including robberies and bag-snatchings, in Iran. There have been reports of robberies by police impersonators, usually in civilian clothing. Insist on seeing the officer’s identity card and request the presence of a uniformed officer/marked patrol car. Travelers should take the following precautions: Do not surrender any documents or cash; Make a copy of your U.S. passport (biographical data page and the page with your Iranian visa) and keep it separate from your original passport; Do not carry large amounts of hard currency while on the streets; Keep important documents such as passports and valuables in hotel safes or other secure locations; Take pre-booked taxis, which are safer than those hailed from the street; Check with your hotel or tour guide for information on local scams; and Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are the bootlegs illegal in the United States, purchasing them may also violate local law. Demonstrations occur sporadically. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Past demonstrations have turned violent. As demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Iranian security personnel may at times place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones, computers, fax machines, and other electronics may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. The Iranian authorities may also confiscate cell phones, computers, and other devices. U.S. citizens should consider not taking electronic devices to Iran or deleting personal information from them beforehand. Disaster Preparedness: Iran is prone to earthquakes, many of them severe.

Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens; People over 65 years of age; People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema; People with heart disease or diabetes; and People who work or are active outdoors. Water Scarcity: Iran has a water scarcity issue throughout the country, largely impacting rural communities. Iran is prone to significant droughts in the hot summer months. In cities outside of Tehran, water may be harder to obtain given the availability in those regions and larger water reserves servicing the capital. Tap water in Iran is relatively safe, however it is recommended to consume bottled water, which is regularly available.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Long prison terms and solitary confinement are common as are punishments including execution, amputation, flogging, blinding, stoning, and fines. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Examples of local laws that you may be unfamiliar with include: Former Muslims who have converted to other religions, as well as persons who encourage Muslims to convert, are subject to arrest and possible execution; Drinking, possession of alcoholic beverages, and drugs are illegal. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Iran are severe and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Iran executes many people each year on drug-related charges. Penalties for the possession, use, or smuggling of alcoholic beverages may include fines, jail time, or flogging; Men and women must adhere to the government-sanctioned dress code; this includes covered hair, arms, and legs for women. The government considers the failure to adhere to its dress code and public displays of affection to be crimes; Relations between non-Muslim men and Muslim women are illegal, as are adultery and sex outside of marriage, which are punishable by the death penalty; Data storage devices (e.g. DVDs, SD cards) depicting sexual relations and magazines showing unveiled women are forbidden; Photography near military and other government installations is strictly prohibited and could result in serious criminal charges, including espionage, which carries the death penalty; Importation of pork products is banned; and Insulting the government or Muslim faith is strictly forbidden, including on social media. Such violations of Iranian law may result in imprisonment. Carry a copy of your U.S. passport (biodata page and page with Iranian visa) and some other form of identification with you at all times so that, if questioned by local officials, proof of U.S. citizenship is readily available. If you are arrested while in Iran, request that the police and prison officials notify the Foreign Interests Section at the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran immediately to ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances. Under Iranian law, detainees may also request legal representation, although the authorities sometimes fail to allow timely access to attorneys. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal: The Iranian government reportedly has the names of all individuals who filed claims against Iran at the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal at The Hague pursuant to the 1981 Algerian Accords. In addition, the Iranian government reportedly has compiled a list of the claimants who were awarded compensation in the Iran Claims Program administered by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. The Iranian government has allegedly been targeting award-holders who travel to Iran. Some former claimants have reported being questioned by Iranian authorities upon their entry into Iran as to the status of payment of their respective awards with a view to recouping the award money. The Iranian government has also reportedly threatened to prevent U.S. claimants who visit Iran from departing the country until they repay their award. Dual Nationality: U.S. citizens who also possess Iranian citizenship are subject to laws that impose special obligations on citizens of Iran, such as military service or taxes. Iranian-citizen males aged 18-34 are required to perform military service, unless exempt. Young men who have turned 17 years of age will not be allowed to leave Iran without completing their military service. Money: Non-Iranian credit cards and bank cards cannot be used in Iran. You will not be able to access U.S. or foreign bank accounts using ATMs in Iran. You can exchange U.S. dollars for rials, either at banks or with certified money changers.

Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Women in Iran lack certain basic rights such as the freedom to choose their style of dress and restrictions on freedoms of expression and assembly. Gender-based violence is more common in Iran than the U.S., especially in rural areas, and reports of this violence in recent years have steadily increased. “Honor killings” or other harmful practices involving mostly women killed by their male relatives in the name of preserving the family’s “honor” are known to occur. There are also reports of fathers or relatives forcing their female family members to enter a marriage against their will. Domestic violence remains a taboo subject in Iran, and Iranian law does not prohibit domestic violence. Hijab enforcement in Iran is becoming stricter. The Government has deployed Hijab enforcers in public to ensure compliance. Hijab defiance has led to assault, arrest and even death."
Iraq,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists increasingly use less-sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds at venues such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems, including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights. Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Da’esh, is a designated terrorist organization, which is active in Syria and near the Iraq border. ISIS and its associated terrorist groups indiscriminately commit attacks and violent atrocities in Iraq despite improved Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and criminal gangs target U.S. citizens for attacks and hostage-taking. Iraq’s northern borders are especially dangerous due to the continued threat of attacks by terrorist groups, armed conflict, aerial bombardment, and civil unrest.  U.S. citizens should especially avoid areas near armed groups in northern Iraq, which have been targeted with aerial strikes by neighboring countries’ militaries. Due to security and safety threats, U.S. government personnel in Iraq live and work under strict security guidelines, which limit their movements and interactions. Crime: Carjacking is common, even during daylight hours, and particularly on the highways from Jordan and Kuwait to Baghdad.  Kidnappings of foreigners, Iraqi citizens, and dual U.S.-Iraqi citizens can occur for ransom or political/religious reasons.  Many hostages have been killed.  The murder rate remains high due to terrorism, tribal and family disputes, and religious/sectarian tensions.  Sexual assault and domestic violence are common.  Petty theft is common in Iraq, including pickpocketing and theft of valuables from hotel rooms and private residences. Demonstrations occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International financial and romance scams can be connected to Iraq.  See the Department of State and the FBI webpages for information. Women Travelers: Female U.S. citizens have been subject to threats, kidnappings, abuse, and extortion by their family, including loss of custody of children or forced marriage.  U.S. laws do not protect U.S. citizens when they are outside of the United States.  The Iraqi police and legal system may offer little protection.  See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Victims of Crime: Report crimes, fires, and accidents to local authorities by dialing 104 (Police), 115 (Fire), 112 (National Emergency Hotline), or 139 (sexual assault and domestic violence).  Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.  They speak Arabic.  U.S. citizen victims may contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance at +964-760-030-3000.  We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion Provide a list of local attorneys Provide information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence in Iraq are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Air Quality Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Iraq. Seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may be especially harmful to the following people: Infants, children, and teens People over 65 years of age People with lung disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema People with heart disease or diabetes People who work or are active outdoors","Criminal Penalties: U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the foreign countries they visit. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, certain acts of U.S. citizens overseas are prosecutable as crimes in the United States even if they are not illegal under the local law.  For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Property Disputes : Land disputes are common in Iraq and are often difficult to resolve through the legal system. The U.S. Embassy cannot take sides in a legal dispute. Those involved in a court dispute risk having claims filed against them, arrest, and being jailed. Special Circumstances: Iraq has serious deficiencies in public services. Electricity often fails. Fire and rescue services are inadequate, and hotels may not be equipped with fire safety equipment. Landline telephone service is limited; while cellular service reliability varies by region. The banking and financial infrastructure is underdeveloped. Transactions are largely cash-based. Hotels usually require payment in foreign currency. Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) are rare. Customs officers have broad authority to search persons or vehicles at Iraqi ports of entry. Officers may confiscate any goods deemed a threat to the peace, security, health, environment, or social order of Iraq. Antiquities, cultural and undeclared items for export may be confiscated. Visitors may be ordered to return such goods, at their expense, to the jurisdiction from which they came. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods : Possession of counterfeit goods may be confiscated or fined. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Dangers of Proselytizing: While proselytizing is not considered a criminal offense under Iraqi law, it may expose you to danger. Iraq is a predominantly Muslim country, and individuals visiting for the purpose of spreading other faiths have been targeted and attacked by armed groups.

In April 2024, the Iraqi Council of Representatives passed an amendment to Iraq’s existing Anti-Prostitution Law which bans same-sex relations with fines ranging from 10 to 15 million IQD, imprisonment of 10 to 15 years, and punishes any persons or organizations that “promote homosexuality”. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section six of our Human Rights report for details. Travelers with Disabilities: Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what they find in the United States. Buildings, public restrooms, classrooms, offices, public transportation, and other places may not be accessible. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: Female U.S. citizens have been subject to threats, kidnappings, abuse, and extortion by their family, including loss of custody of children or forced marriage. U.S. laws do not protect U.S. citizens when they are outside of the United States. The Iraqi police and legal system may offer little protection.  See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Ireland,"Terrorism : Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Crime : Although Ireland has a low rate of violent crime, you should always follow common sense personal security practices and maintain awareness of your surroundings when traveling. Rates of theft and petty crime have risen in recent years, and thieves often target tourists. In rare cases, these crimes involve physical assault or violence, more commonly in Dublin city center and in popular tourist areas. Rental cars are frequently targeted. They are easily identifiable by the rental company stickers on the rear window of the vehicle. If possible, remove these stickers and always lock your car when leaving it unattended. Do not leave valuables unattended in vehicles. When visiting city center areas, park your car in a secure car park and retain the parking ticket on your person. Keep car doors locked while driving. Don’t leave luggage or valuables visible inside a parked car and don’t leave luggage on a roof rack. When picking up and dropping off your rental car, do not leave the keys in the ignition while loading or unloading luggage. When using ATMs, protect your PIN at all times and look closely at ATMs for evidence of tampering before use. Criminals may use small electronic devices attached to the outside of ATMs called “skimmers” to steal the ATM or credit card data. In busy areas, thieves use distraction techniques at ATMs, such as waiting until the PIN has been entered and then pointing to money on the ground or asking for loose change. While the ATM user is distracted, another person will quickly withdraw cash and leave. If you are distracted in any way, cancel the transaction immediately. When using credit cards to pay at restaurants, a portable card reader should be brought to your table. Restaurant staff should not take your card elsewhere to process a charge. International Financial Scams : See the Department of State and FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 999 or 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(353) (1) 668-8777.

Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .","As of March 6, 2022, the Government of Ireland removed all COVID-19 related travel restrictions to enter Ireland. Non-Irish citizens no longer need to complete a passenger locator form or provide proof of vaccination, or a COVID-19 test. Patients who do not receive benefits from Ireland’s Department of Social Protection are expected to pay all costs up-front at the time of treatment and apply for reimbursement from their insurance provider later. Modern medical facilities and highly skilled medical practitioners are available in Ireland. Expect long waits for access to medical specialists and admissions to hospitals for non-life-threatening medical conditions. It is not unusual for emergency room services to be very busy or for post-treatment admissions to include a long wait (sometimes overnight) on a gurney in a hallway. We advise you carry your medical history, along with a detailed list of any medication you currently take (including dosage and brand name) in your wallet or purse and luggage. Most types of over-the-counter medications are available, but many U.S. brands are not. Some medications available over the counter in the United States may require a prescription in Ireland. Irish pharmacists may not be able to dispense medication prescribed by U.S. physicians and may direct you to obtain a prescription from an Irish doctor. A list of Irish general practitioners in each area of Ireland may be obtained from the website of the Irish College of General Practitioners . Ambulance services are widely available. For emergency services in Ireland dial 112 or 999. The Department of State does not pay medical bills . Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Government of Ireland to ensure the medication is legal in Ireland. Vaccinations : Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pharmaceuticals : Visitors to Ireland may bring up to 3 months’ supply of prescription medicines with them for their own personal use. We recommend that travelers bring the prescription medicines in their original packaging, with their name clearly displayed. This should be accompanied by their prescription or a copy of it, and/or a letter from their doctor and/or dispensing pharmacist outlining their condition and stating that the medicines are for their own personal use. This information should be inside the package in which the medication is being transported, as a means of proving the legitimacy of consignment for importation to Ireland. It should be noted that the Irish Customs Authority has the final say in all such matters. Schengen residents are required to have an Article 75 Schengen Certificate for prescribed narcotics and/or psychotropic substances on entry into Ireland if travelling from a Schengen area country. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our webpage on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website . Arrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Currency in Ireland: The currency used in Ireland is the Euro. U.S. dollars are not legal tender in Ireland and are not an accepted form of payment. There are limited locations to exchange U.S. dollars when in Ireland, should you travel with cash.  Payment by credit card and Apple pay is widely accepted throughout Ireland. However, it is important to note that not all U.S credit cards are universally accepted. Most Irish banks will not accept U.S. $100 bills. Many Irish financial institutions no longer accept or cash traveler’s checks. ATMs are widely available, but some, particularly in rural areas, may not accept debit cards from U.S. banks.

See our LGBTQIA+ Travel Information page and section 6 of the Department of State’s Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Ireland prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. However, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation different from what is offered in the United States. Government Buildings : Irish law requires access to government buildings for persons with disabilities, and this requirement is enforced. Under Irish law, public service providers should ensure the service is accessible to those with mobility, sensory, and/or cognitive impairments. Parking : On-street parking, public building parking lots, and internal parking lots always have a certain number of disabled spaces available. A permit is required to use these spaces, and information on applying for the permit can be found on the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland website . Local authorities and commercial premises, such as shopping outlets, have no legal obligation to provide external disabled parking facilities for their customers. Buses and Trains : The majority of buses and trains in the main city areas of Ireland are now equipped for those with limited mobility, sight, or hearing disabilities, although some train stations and pathways may not be as easily accessible. Mainline and Suburban Trains : Portable ramps permit boarding from platforms to the carriages. These ramps are available at all terminal points and major junctions and stations that have staff on duty. They are also available on some trains. Travelers are advised to contact Irish Rail in advance to ensure such facilities are available. The website for Dublin Bus provides information on its travel assistance scheme. Regional and intercity bus services are provided by Bus Eireann Private Businesses : Accessibility in private businesses – such as hotels, bed and breakfasts, shops, and restaurants – varies widely. Travelers should inquire about accessibility issues with businesses before making reservations.

Please view the current Travel Advisory for Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza for detailed information regarding the terrorism threat in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. Mortar and Rocket Fire or Hostile Aircraft Intrusion : In the event of mortar or rocket fire or Hostile Aircraft Intrusion , a “red alert” siren may be activated. Treat all such alerts as real. Follow the instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. Know the location of your closest shelter or protected space. U.S. government personnel and their family members may be restricted from traveling to areas affected by rocket activity, sirens, and/or the opening of bomb shelters. For additional information on appropriate action to take upon hearing a siren or explosion, see the Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command website (available on devices within Israel) or view the Preparedness Information. U.S. citizens may also wish to download the free Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command application on Android or Apple devices to receive real-time security and safety alerts. Free commercial applications, such as Red Alert: Israel, are also available. Crime: The crime rate is moderate in Israel and the West Bank. Parked vehicle break-ins are common at public beach areas, national parks, and other tourist sites. Vehicle theft also remains a problem. U.S. citizens should not leave their valuables (including passports) unattended in parked vehicles, on the beach, or unsecured in hotels. Visitors should be aware of their surroundings in tourist areas and watch for crimes of opportunity, such as pickpockets.  The crime rate in Gaza is now unknown given the ongoing armed conflict between Israel and Hamas. For additional information, read the most recent Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) Crime and Safety Report for Israel . Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Technology Usage Abroad : Mobiles Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices include making sure all software (operating system and apps) are updated prior to traveling abroad and using virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible while abroad. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. GPS navigation applications (apps) can help you get around in a foreign country. Prior to using a GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. A GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without accounting for the safety of that route. Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and trained staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.","For emergency services in Israel, dial 101 for ambulances, and 100 for police. Modern medical care and medicines are available in Israel. Some hospitals in Israel, most hospitals in the West Bank, and all hospitals in Gaza, however, fall below Western standards. Travelers can find information in English about emergency medical facilities and after-hours pharmacies in the Jerusalem Post and the English-language edition of the Ha'aretz newspaper, or refer to the U.S. Embassy’s medical information list . Ambulance services are widely available in Israel. Ambulance services in the West Bank are available but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. The U.S. government does not have knowledge of the standards of ambulance services in Gaza, but their capabilities have been degraded by the ongoing armed conflict between Hamas and Israel. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) operates in the West Bank and Gaza.

Medical staff may speak little or no English. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on medical tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Pharmaceuticals Exercise caution when purchasing medication in Israel. Pharmaceuticals, both those available over the counter and those requiring a prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with few restrictions or controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States.

In many areas of the West Bank and most areas of Gaza, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Adventure Travel Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel .","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to the local laws of the locations you visit or reside in. Foreign laws and legal systems can be significantly different from those of the United States. If you violate Israeli or Palestinian Authority (PA) laws, even unknowingly, being a U.S. citizen will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. The Israeli government will treat dual U.S-Israeli citizens as Israeli citizens, and the Palestinian Authority will treat dual U.S.-PA passport holders as PA ""citizens”– regardless of whether they entered Israel or PA-administered area on a U.S. passport. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking illegal drugs in Israel and PA-administered areas are severe and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Individuals expressing views, including on social media, which the Government of Israel considers incitement to violence or hate speech may face criminal penalties, even if the the substance and manner in which those views are expressed would be lawful in the United States. PA security officials have also arrested Palestinians who posted criticism of the PA and PA leadership online. In Gaza, individuals publicly criticizing authorities risk reprisal by Hamas, including arrest, interrogation, seizure of property, and harassment. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrests and Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify U.S. Embassy Jerusalem or Branch Office Tel Aviv immediately. See our website on arrest or detention of a U.S. citizen abroad for further information. While the U.S. Embassy may not recommend a particular foreign attorney, the embassy website has the names of several attorneys who have identified themselves as willing to assist U.S. citizen clients. Please note that inclusion on this list in no way represents an endorsement of services by the Department or the U.S. government. Arrests and Arrest Notification by Israel: The Government of Israel is required by a bilateral treaty and customary international law to promptly notify the U.S. Embassy when a U.S. citizen is arrested in Israel to inform them that if the citizen is a U.S. citizen and requests that the U.S. Embassy be notified and makes such a request. In case of arrest or detention, U.S. citizens should promptly identify themselves as such to the arresting authorities and request that the authorities notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. There are credible reports that U.S. citizens have been mistreated by Israeli security forces during their arrest and interrogation. Some youths over the age of 12 have been tried as adults; youths over the age of 14 can be imprisoned. Arrestees have also reported pressure to sign documents in Hebrew that they do not understand. U.S. citizens arrested in Israel for criminal or security offenses are entitled to legal representation provided by the Government of Israel. U.S. citizens arrested by Israeli authorities for security offenses may be prevented from communicating with lawyers, family members, or consular officers for lengthy periods. Even after notification, consular access to the arrested individual may be delayed for days to several weeks. Under Israeli law, individuals detained for security offenses may be held for up to six months without charges. Arrests and Arrest Notification by the Palestinian Authority (PA): In case of arrest or detention, U.S. citizens should promptly identify themselves as such to the arresting authorities and should request that the U.S. Embassy be notified immediately. Individuals arrested by PA security forces in the West Bank for security offenses may be prohibited from communicating with lawyers, family members, or consular officers for lengthy periods. In addition, they may be held in custody for long periods without formal charges or before being brought before a judge for an arrest extension. The PA often does not notify the U.S. Embassy of such arrests, and consular access to arrestees is often delayed. There are credible reports that arrested individuals, including U.S. citizens, have been mistreated by PA security forces during their arrest and interrogation. Gaza: Since Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, they have dominated security matters in Gaza, but this control has been degraded by Israel’s ongoing military operations against Hamas. The U.S. government is severely limited in what it can do to assist those detained in Gaza. In case of arrest or detention by Israeli security forces in Gaza, U.S. citizens should promptly identify themselves as such to the arresting authorities and should request that the U.S. Embassy be notified immediately. Israeli Court Jurisdiction: Military, civil and religious courts in Israel actively exercise their authority to bar certain individuals, including nonresidents, from leaving the country until debts or other legal claims and matters against them are resolved. Israel's religious courts exercise jurisdiction over all citizens and residents of Israel in cases of marriage, divorce, child custody, and child support. U.S. citizens, including those without Israeli citizenship, may be subject to involuntary and prolonged stays (and even imprisonment) in Israel if a case is filed against them in a religious court, even if their marriage took place in the United States, and regardless of whether their spouse is present in Israel. The U.S. Embassy is unable to cancel the debt of a U.S. citizen or guarantee their departure from Israel when they face a bar from leaving the country until debts are resolved. Purchases of Property: U.S. citizens should always seek legal advice before buying or leasing property in the West Bank and Gaza. Please see the most recent Investment Climate Statement for the West Bank and Gaza for additional information on property rights. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods also may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website and U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad International Volunteers: Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Rights: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) events in Israel. Israeli anti-discrimination laws protect LGBTQI+ individuals. Acceptance and tolerance of LGBQTI+ people vary throughout the country and from neighborhood to neighborhood. As of August 2014, the Law of Return allows that same-sex spouses of Jews immigrating to Israel – known as “making Aliyah” – are eligible to make Aliyah with their spouses and receive Israeli citizenship. The legal systems in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are based on the 1960 Jordanian penal code which prohibits consensual same-sex sexual activity. However, the PA has not prosecuted individuals suspected of such activity. Societal discrimination, including from families, based on cultural and religious traditions is commonplace, making the West Bank and Gaza challenging environments for LGBTQI+ persons. PA security officers have harassed, abused, and sometimes arrested LGBTQI+ individuals because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. NGOs have reported that Hamas also harassed and detained persons in Gaza due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. LGBTQI+ travelers are encouraged to remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings, especially when entering religious or socially conservative areas. Israel’s Aguda organization provides useful information on LGBTQI+ issues in Israel. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of the Department of State's Human Rights report for further details. Persons with Mobility Issues: Individuals with mobility issues may find accessibility and accommodation in Israel very different from in the United States. Legislation mandates access to buildings and transportation, as well as accommodations for persons with disabilities in services and the workplace. However, the government enforces the laws with only limited success. Societal discrimination and lack of accessibility persist in employment and housing. The law mandates accessibility to urban public transportation but not to intercity buses. Most train stations maintain access for persons with disabilities; however, many buses still do not have such access. Television stations include subtitles or sign language, and the courts accommodate testimony from persons with intellectual disabilities or mental illness. Tourists will find restaurants, foot paths, and public transportation less accessible than in the United States. PA law prohibits discrimination based on disability. The Palestinian Disability Law was ratified in 1999, but implementation has been slow. It does not mandate access to buildings, information, or communications. Palestinians with disabilities continue to receive uneven and poor-quality services and care. Familial and societal discrimination against persons with disabilities exists in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips .

Italian authorities and foreign diplomatic facilities have found bombs outside public buildings, have received bomb threats, and have been targets of letter bombs, firebombs and Molotov cocktails in the past several years. These attacks generally occur at night, and although they have not targeted or injured U.S. citizens, you should remain aware of your surroundings and report any suspicious activity to local authorities. Crime: Italy has a moderate rate of crime, especially for theft and economic crimes; violent crimes are rare. U.S. citizens should be aware of the following local circumstances: Tourists can be fined or detained for buying counterfeit goods (usually fashion accessories). Travelers must purchase train, bus, or metro tickets and validate them by punching them in validating machines prior to boarding (usually near the entrance of the train or metro or on the bus). Tickets may be purchased at tobacco stores or kiosks or, in some cities, via Apps or SMS. Failure to follow this procedure may result in an on-the-spot fine by an inspector on the train, bus, or metro. If the violator does not pay the fine on the spot, it will automatically double and be forwarded to the violator’s home address. Be alert that many municipalities of cities in Italy have issued local restrictions banning certain activities in fountains or on monuments, such as eating, drinking, sitting, or bathing, as well as regarding the consumption of alcohol both indoors and outdoors after certain hours of the night. Violating these regulations can result in fines. Tourists are advised to check the official website of each city they plan to visit to learn the details. Thieves sometimes impersonate police officers. If you are stopped by a plainclothes policeman, ask for a uniformed officer or insist on seeing an officer's identification card (documento). Do not hand over your wallet and immediately report the incident to the actual police at a police station or by dialing 112 from a local phone. Do not leave bags unattended. Most reported thefts occur at crowded tourist sites, at airports, car rental agencies, on public buses, metros and trains, and at the major railway stations. Never leave baggage alone in a car, including in a closed trunk. For more information on trains and security, please see the Italian railway police’s advice for travelers . Be alert to criminal schemes. Organized groups of thieves and pickpockets operate at major tourist destinations, in train stations, bars, and cafes. Some travelers have reported incidents in which criminals used drugs to assault or rob them. Thieves on motor scooters regularly snatch purses or bags off pedestrians. Resisting these thieves can be dangerous. Keep your car doors locked and windows rolled up at all times to avoid car-jackings and thefts while you are waiting in traffic. The U.S. Secret Service in Rome is assisting Italian law enforcement authorities in investigating an increase in the appearance of ATM skimming devices. Here are some helpful hints to protect against and identify skimming devices: Use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or secured inside a bank/business. Cover the keypad with one hand as you enter your PIN. Look for gaps, tampered appearance, or other irregularities between the metal faceplate of the ATM and the card reader. Avoid card readers that are not flush with the face of the ATM. Closely monitor your account statements for unauthorized transactions. Potential for Natural Disasters: Several major earthquake fault lines cross Italy, and earthquakes are frequent. High tides in Venice, flooding, and avalanches in mountainous areas may occasionally occur. The Italian Civil Protection agency has a robust capability to assist Italians and foreigners in the area of a natural disaster. Information about crisis preparedness and on-going crises affecting parts of Italy can be found on the Civil Protection web site at: Civil Protection Italy . General information about disaster preparedness is also available online from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Detailed information on Italy's fault lines is available from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Italy also has several active volcanoes, including Mt. Etna in eastern Sicily. Travelers to Sicily should be aware of the possibility for travel disruptions, including airport closures, in the event of volcanic activity, and are advised to check the website of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia for detailed information and daily updates. Italy has many other areas of potential volcanic activity especially in the vicinity of Naples. Any visit to an active volcano or volcanic field bears a certain amount of risk. Eruptions can occur with little to no warning. Travelers should exercise caution, follow posted instructions, stay on authorized trails, and use reputable tour operators. Demonstrations occur frequently and can be anti-American in nature, especially in areas hosting U.S. military bases. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Security Messages for U.S. citizens pertaining to demonstrations can be found on the Embassy’s website. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Italy. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should seek medical attention at the nearest public hospital as soon as possible. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are also encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance at +(39) 06-4674-1. Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .

If you are a victim of terrorism or organized crime in Italy, you are entitled to economic (special compensation and a life income) and non-economic benefits (special access to certain state jobs). In case of death, victims will include family members. You must file the application with the local Prefect’s office (Prefettura - the local representative for the Ministry of Interior) where the crime occurred, providing the date, location, injuries, and losses resulting from the crime. If you are a victim of a hit and run driver, you can apply for compensation of damages to the Fondo Di Garanzia per le Vittime della Strada but only if: (i) the responsible vehicle cannot be identified, is not covered by car insurance, or it circulated against the owner’s will; (ii) if the car insurance company went bankrupt; or (iii) if the accident was caused by a foreign vehicle with a license number that does not match or does not match anymore that same vehicle. U.S. citizens should consult an attorney licensed to practice in Italy to clarify time limits for a specific legal action. Victims of hit and run drivers and their families may seek assistance by reaching out to an Italian non-governmental organization (NGO) called Associazione Italiana Familiari e Vittime della Strada (AIFVS), “Association of Italian Family Members and Victims of Hit and Run Drivers”. AIFVS provides legal and psychological assistance through a network of professionals associated with the NGO. Please visit AIFVS for more details. If you are a victim of a violent intentional crime, you are entitled to compensation from the Italian government to cover the medical and welfare expenses you incurred, except for sexual assaults and murders cases where the compensation is due even if no medical and welfare expense was sustained. To be eligible for the compensation, your annual income must be within a certain limit. In addition, you must prove that you have already unsuccessfully tried to enforce the decision ordering compensation for damages. We recommend you contact an attorney licensed to practice in Italy for more information. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or nearest Consulate for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","For emergency services in Italy, dial 112 . Ambulance services are widely available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Medical facilities are available but may be limited outside urban areas. Public hospitals may not maintain the same standards as hospitals in the United States. It is not possible to obtain an itemized hospital bill from public hospitals, as required by many U.S. insurance companies, because the Italian National Health Service charges one inclusive rate for care services and room and board. Private hospitals require you to pay for all services up front and get reimbursed later from your insurance company. We do not pay medical bills . Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage overseas.

Tourists should know that by law, hospitals will continue with lifesaving procedures indefinitely regardless of a person’ preferences stated in a will or advanced directive. Pharmaceuticals: The Italian Ministry of Health sets rules defining who and how prescriptions and medications can be imported into Italy. However, the Ministry of Health website does not have information in English. According to the Ministry of Health, foreigners entering Italy are allowed to bring personal medications for a period of 30 days, but it is recommended that travelers also bring a copy of their prescription with them. Travelers should not bring excess supplies of prescription drugs into the country and cannot bring prescription drugs for other people. The import of medications into Italy by courier services or by mail is strictly regulated by Italian Customs laws. Italian customs clears all incoming shipments of medications, even small amounts for personal use. Delays in the release of medications by Italian Customs received by mail or by courier services are common. The receiving party must be able to provide a statement signed by a physician licensed in Italy, certifying: The medication is essential for the patient, that he/she would be put in a life-threatening situation without it. There is no substitute or equivalent medication available on the Italian market. Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with minimal controls. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information.

Many cities in Italy have air pollution levels similar to those in major U.S. cities. In parts of Italy, the lack of adequate trash disposal and incineration sites has led to periodic accumulations of garbage. In some cases, residents have burned garbage, resulting in toxic emissions that can aggravate respiratory problems. Visit the European Environment Agency’s website for information on air quality in Italy. Health Facilities: The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Adequate health facilities are available throughout Italy, but health services may be below U.S. standards.

Travelers should make efforts to obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care. Medical staff may speak little or no English. Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. In most cases, patients bear costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on Medical Tourism. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.

Jamaica,"Crime: Violent crime, including sexual assault, is a serious problem throughout Jamaica, particularly in Kingston and Montego Bay. Jamaica’s police force often does not respond effectively to serious criminal incidents. When arrests are made, cases are infrequently prosecuted to a conclusive sentence. Families of U.S. citizens killed in accidents or homicides frequently wait a year or more for final death certificates to be issued by Jamaican authorities. Gated resorts are not immune to violent crime. Recommendations: Avoid walking or driving at night. Avoid public buses. Avoid secluded places or situations. Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Be aware of your surroundings and keep a low profile. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency. Follow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter . Review the Crime and Safety Report for Jamaica. U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler’s Checklist . International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Jamaica. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.  Common scams include: Lotteries Romance/Online dating Money transfers The most notorious Jamaican scam is the Lotto Scam, a kind of advance-fee fraud. The victim is led to believe that a Jamaican lottery prize will be released after the payment of “fees.” You did NOT win a lottery. The person on the telephone is lying. Just hang up. Never send money to someone who calls to say you have won the lottery in Jamaica. Do not travel to Jamaica to collect a “prize.” Victims have been killed, kidnapped, extorted, or robbed. Be very cautious about sending money to help a traveler claiming to be in trouble. When in doubt, contact your local police department for advice and assistance. Be wary of promises to protect a loved one from harm or to help the loved one out of trouble, in exchange for money. That is extortion – contact your local police department. Scam artists often fake romantic interest to get money from a would-be lover, especially on the internet. When in doubt, contact your local police department. If you are being targeted for financial scams, you will need to file a report with your local police department.

Sexual Assault: Rape and sexual assault are serious problems throughout Jamaica, including at resorts and hotels. Date rape drugs may be used at private parties and resorts. If you are victim of a sexual assault, contact the police and the U.S. Embassy in Kingston as soon as possible. In a hotel, management should assist you with these communications. Victims of sexual assault in Jamaica should not expect the same assistance routinely offered in the United States. Rape kits are not always available, and victims must often ask for medication to avoid STD transmission and reduce the chances of pregnancy. Counseling is unlikely to be offered. Law enforcement shortcomings exist in collection of evidence. Prosecution of rape cases moves very slowly, and victims may need to return to Jamaica during the legal process. Recommendations: Avoid secluded places or situations, including at resorts. Try to always be accompanied by someone you know, including when going to the restroom. Security outside of resort areas is unpredictable, especially at night. Do not leave resort property with someone you have just met. Many guests drink heavily in all-inclusive resorts, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and increased vulnerability. Shout for help immediately if you feel threatened or encounter individuals who make you feel uncomfortable. Report any suspicious or inappropriate activity, including inappropriate comments or behavior by hotel employees or other guests, to hotel management, the U.S. Embassy, and local police as appropriate.R esort employees are generally prohibited from engaging in romantic or sexual relations with guests.

There is also a law that specifically prohibits even consensual same-sex sexual conduct between men. Negative attitudes towards LGBTQI+ issues are widespread in Jamaica. There are continued reports of serious discrimination and abuse against LGBTQI+ individuals, including: Assault “Corrective rape” of women accused of being lesbians Arbitrary detention Mob attacks Stabbings Harassment of LGBTQI+ patients by hospital and prison staff Blackmail See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights Report for further details. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) individuals have been targeted through the use of dating apps, especially apps popular within the LGBTQI+ communities.  Criminals have used dating apps to lure foreign visitors into meeting in public spaces such as hotel restaurants and bars, and then later assaulting, threatening , and or robbing the victims. Police have not been responsive in making arrests or prosecuting assailants in these cases. Protect your identity and be careful about sharing personal information on your public profile. Remember that criminals both in the United States and abroad use dating apps to extort victims through threats to expose compromising pictures or other information.  Only share personal information with users who you trust, and be aware of phishing and romance scams. Don’t rush into things; try to verify through social media or mutual friends that the person you are communicating with is who they say they are.  Make sure you have a photo and name of the person you plan to meet through an app. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Jamaica prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, although the law is not reliably enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.  The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities and information.

Japan,"For police services in Japan, dial 110. For fire or ambulance services, dial 119. Crime: Crime against U.S. citizens in Japan is generally low and usually involves personal disputes, theft, or vandalism. In addition: Robberies committed after a victim has been drugged from a spiked drink can occur, especially in nightlife districts. Sexual assaults are not often reported, but they do occur, and victims may be randomly targeted.  Victim's assistance resources or shelters are difficult for foreigners to access. Hate-related violent crimes rarely occur, although some U.S. citizens have reported being the target of discrimination because of their nationality or their race. Pick pocketing can occur in crowded shopping areas, on trains, and at airports. Police reports must be filed before leaving Japan, as Japanese police will not accept reports filed from overseas. In instances involving credit card theft or fraud, Japanese police often provide a report number rather than a police report.  You can provide this report number to your credit card company to confirm the incident with the police. Entertainment and Nightlife Districts in Tokyo: Exercise caution in all entertainment and nightlife districts throughout Japan, especially Roppongi, Kabuki-cho, Shibuya, and Ikebukuro. Incidents involving U.S. citizens in these areas include physical and sexual assaults, drug overdoses, theft of purses, wallets, cash and credit cards at bars or clubs, and drugs slipped into drinks. Drink spiking at bars and entertainment venues, especially in areas such as Roppongi and Kabuki-cho, near Shinjuku, has led to robbery, physical and sexual assaults, and credit card fraud.  Some victims regain consciousness in the bar or club; other victims may awaken on the street or other unfamiliar locations. U.S. citizens have reported being threatened with gun or knife violence in such venues so that they will pay exorbitant bar tabs or withdraw money.  U.S. citizens have also reported being beaten when they have refused to pay or hand over money. There have been reports of U.S. citizens being forcibly taken to ATMs and robbed, or made to withdraw funds after being unable to pay exorbitant bar tabs. Please be aware that Roppongi, Kabuki-cho, and other entertainment and nightlife districts have also been the scenes of violence between criminal syndicates.

Air Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to Japanese law while you are in Japan. If you violate Japanese laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned, or deported. If you are arrested in Japan, even for a minor offense , you may be held in detention without bail for several months or more during the investigation and legal proceedings. Some offences are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of Japanese law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. The vast majority of arrests of U.S. citizens in Japan are for drug-related offenses. Japanese authorities aggressively pursue drug smugglers and users, including recreational users with sophisticated detection equipment, ""sniffing"" dogs, blood tests, “stop and frisk” tactics, and other methods. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking a drug that is illegal in Japan are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and fines. Please note that some drugs which may be legal in certain jurisdictions outside of Japan, including marijuana and synthetic drugs, remain illegal in Japan. This also applies to certain prescription drugs that doctors in the United States may prescribe.  Japanese law makes no distinction between medical and recreational marijuana; therefore, having a prescription for medical marijuana will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. Even possession of a small amount of marijuana for personal medical or recreational use can result in a long jail sentence and fine. Japanese customs officials carefully screen incoming packages, and individuals who are mailed drugs can be arrested and prosecuted as drug traffickers. Confiscation of Prescription Drugs and Other Medication: It is important to note that some medications that are routinely prescribed in the United States, including Adderall and marijuana, are strictly prohibited in Japan. The Japanese government decides which medications may be imported legally into Japan. The Embassy and Consulates of Japan in the United States have limited information available and do not have a comprehensive list of specific medications or ingredients. Please see more information on importing medicines into Japan. You must carry your U.S. passport or Japanese Residence Card (Zairyu Kado) with you at all times. In Japan, you may be taken in for questioning if you do not have your passport or Japanese residence card to show your identity and status in Japan (e.g., as a visitor, student, worker, or permanent resident). It is illegal to work in Japan while in tourist or visa-waiver status. Overstaying your visa or working illegally may lead to fines of several thousands of dollars, and in some cases, re-entry bans as long as 10 years, or indefinitely for drug offenders. For additional information, please see Japan’s Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act and contact the Japanese Embassy or nearest Japanese Consulate in the United States for more information. Driving under the influence of alcohol could also land you immediately in jail. The blood-alcohol limit in Japan is 0.03%. Punishments can be up to 10,000 USD in fines and up to five years in prison. Possession of a gun or ammunition is a crime in Japan. Carrying a knife with a locking blade, or a folding blade that is longer than 5.5 cm (a little more than two inches), is illegal in Japan. U.S. citizens and U.S. military personnel have been arrested and detained for more than 10 days for carrying pocket knives that are legal in the United States but illegal in Japan. The possession of lock-picking tools is illegal in Japan. Establishing a Business : Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. A list of English-speaking lawyers located throughout Japan is available on our website . Arrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See the Department of State’s webpage and the Embassy’s website for additional information. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice’s website for more information . Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTI+ events in Japan. Laws governing rape, sexual commerce, and other activity involving sexual relations do not apply to same-sex sexual activity. This leads to lower penalties for perpetrators of same-sex rape and sexual assault and greater legal ambiguity surrounding same-sex prostitution. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Japan prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities. Japanese disability laws require the public sector to provide reasonable accommodations and the private sector to make best efforts in employment, education, access to health care, or the provision of other services; however, there are no penalties for noncompliance. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Although Japan’s accessibility laws mandate that new construction projects for public use include provisions for persons with disabilities, older buildings are not likely to have been retrofitted for accessibility. At major train stations, airports, and hotels, travelers with disabilities should encounter few accessibility problems. Note that many smaller stations are inaccessible to those who cannot climb stairs. Information on travel in Japan for travelers with disabilities is available at Accessible Japan . Travelers with disabilities can learn more about resources available in country from the Japan National Tourism Organization’s traveling with a disability page . Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Conditions at Prisons and Detention Facilities: Japanese prisons and detention facilities maintain internal order through a regime of very strict discipline.  U.S. citizen prisoners often complain of stark, austere living conditions and psychological isolation.  Heating in winter can be inadequate in some facilities, food portions can be significantly smaller than what many may be accustomed to, and access to specialized medical care, particularly mental health care, at detention facilities and prisons is sometimes limited. Additional information on arrests in Japan is available on our embassy website. Customs Regulations: Please contact the Japanese Embassy or nearest Japanese consulate in the United States, or visit the Japanese Customs website for specific information regarding import restrictions and customs requirements. Japanese customs authorities encourage the use of an Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission (ATA) Carnet in order to temporarily import professional equipment, commercial samples, and/or goods for exhibitions and trade fairs into Japan.  For additional information, please call (212) 354-4480, or email the U.S. CIB for details. Pets: The Japanese Animal Quarantine Service (AQS) sets procedures for importing pets. At a minimum, the process will take seven to eight months, though the process can take up to a year before a pet may enter Japan. Advance planning is critical. You can find more information about importing a pet into Japan or information about exporting a pet from Japan on our Embassy website. Employment Issues: U.S. citizens should not come to Japan to work without having the proper employment visa arranged ahead of time. Teaching English, even privately, and serving as hosts/hostesses are both considered ""work"" in Japan and are illegal without the proper visa. Some U.S.-based employment agencies and Japanese employers do not fully or correctly represent the true nature of employment terms and conditions. A minimum requirement for effectively seeking the protection of Japanese labor law is a written and signed work contract. If there is no signed contract, Japanese authorities are not able to act on behalf of foreign workers. If you are coming to Japan to work, carefully review your contract and the history and reputation of your Japanese employer before traveling to Japan. Complaints against U.S.-based employment agencies or recruiters may be directed to the Better Business Bureau or the Office of the Attorney General in the relevant state(s). Disaster Preparedness : Japan is prone to natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, tsunamis, and landslides. See the Embassy’s webpage for recommendations and steps you can take to prepare for an emergency. The Japan Tourism Organization’s Safety Tips app and NHK World app provide Japanese government emergency “J-Alerts” to your cell phone in English through push notifications. “J-Alerts” can provide early warning emergency alerts on earthquakes predicted in a specific area, sometimes seconds before an earthquake hits. Radiation: Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant : The Government of Japan continues to closely monitor the conditions at and around the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. You should comply with all travel restrictions and cautions put into place by the Government of Japan for areas surrounding the plant. For more information, contact the Japan Nuclear Regulation Authority ."
Jordan,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) The threat of terrorism remains high in Jordan. Transnational and indigenous terrorist groups have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement attacks in Jordan. Violent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, including the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS), and al-Qa’ida, directly or indirectly have conducted or supported attacks in Jordan and continue to plot against local security forces, U.S. and Western interests and “soft” targets, such as high-profile public events, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, schools, and malls. Jordan’s prominent role in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and its shared borders with Iraq and Syria increase the potential for future terrorist incidents. Travelers to Jordan should be aware that violent extremist groups have carried out terrorist activities against U.S. and Government of Jordan targets in Jordan. Jordanian security services have conducted multiple operations to disrupt terrorist plots and operations. In November 2019, a lone terrorist stabbed eight people, including four foreigners, at the Jerash tourist site. The perpetrator was immediately arrested and charged with committing a terrorist act. U.S. government personnel must have permission for official travel on Highway 10 east of the town of Ruwayshid toward the Iraq border, due to Jordanian military activity, known smuggling routes, and a lack of emergency facilities. U.S. government employees are not permitted to visit most border areas or any refugee camps on personal travel, and the Embassy advises U.S. citizens to avoid both locations. On occasion, the U.S. Embassy temporarily makes other areas within Jordan off limits to its staff based on the security situation. This information will be shared with the U.S. citizen community through our website and through a message to STEP enrollees. In general, terrorists often do not distinguish between U.S. government personnel and private U.S. citizens. Terrorists may target areas frequented by Westerners, such as tourist sites, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, liquor stores, shopping malls, transportation hubs, places of worship, expatriate residential areas, and schools. In light of these security concerns, U.S. citizens should maintain a high level of vigilance: be aware of your surroundings take appropriate steps to increase your security awareness be unpredictable in your movements by varying your times and routes maintain a low profile avoid contact with any suspicious or unfamiliar objects and immediately report the presence of such objects to local authorities U.S. government personnel overseas have been advised to take the same precautions. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Statistically, petty crime is the most common form of crime that U.S. citizens and other Western nationals experience in Jordan, especially at tourist sites and in crowded areas. Pickpockets, purse snatchers, and opportunistic thieves are known to target foreigners in the narrow and crowded streets of the older parts of Amman’s city center. Travelers should be alert in these areas and in all tourist locations in Jordan. Jordanian police have warned the public to exercise vigilance when leaving banks or ATMs, to reduce likelihood of targeting by thieves. Thefts of vehicles, assaults, robbery, and attempted residential break-ins have also been reported. Take care not to display valuables in your car or on your person and be sure to lock car doors and windows. Violent crime does occur, but U.S. citizens or other Westerners are rarely targeted. In the past, the Embassy has received reports of firearms being discharged at vehicles being driven by Westerners. Celebratory gunfire is common, especially during major festivals, sporting events, or the biannual release of high school test scores. Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods. Not only are the pirated copies illegal in the United States, if you purchase them, you will also be breaking local law. Most DVDs, CDs, and software available for sale in Jordan are pirated. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. In general, demonstrations remain peaceful. However, some have turned violent, even when intended to be peaceful, leading security officials to intervene. Travelers should avoid all protests and large gatherings of people. Many demonstrations occur on Thursday evenings near government buildings and on Fridays near mosques following mid-day prayers. You should exercise special sensitivity and caution when visiting or traveling near mosques and religious sites during holy days and Fridays. Demonstrations and other forms of unrest have occurred on public university campuses in Jordan. Some acts of violence on university campuses have involved the use of firearms. Although generally peaceful, anti-U.S. demonstrations have also taken place in front of the U.S. Embassy. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 911. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault or domestic violence are encouraged to contact 911 and ask to be put in touch with the Family Protection Directorate, part of the national police, which is staffed 24/7 and has some English-speaking personnel. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. U.S. citizen victims of crime may contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance at (6) 590-6950. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should call 911 and ask to speak to the Family Protection Directorate which is tasked with assisting and investigating issues of domestic violence. U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Flash Flooding: Certain areas of Jordan, including Petra, the Dead Sea, and other tourist areas, are prone to heavy rain and flash flooding, especially from October-March. Roads and bridges may become impassable and the Jordanian government may close tourist areas completely. The first rains of the season in particular often cause flooding throughout Amman and other cities in Jordan. It is important to watch the weather reports and heed local recommendations. The Jordanian government may send out Arabic language text messages to all cell phones registered in Jordan when inclement weather, such as heavy rain, occurs. Tribal Violence: Clashes between feuding tribes, clans, or families periodically erupt without notice and sometimes involve violence, including the use of firearms. In some cases, Jordanian security services are slow to respond or may opt to let the violence subside before intervening. Syria and Iraq Borders: U.S. citizens should avoid the border areas with Syria and Iraq. All U.S. government personnel on official travel must receive prior permission to visit any area within 10 km of the Jordan-Syria border, except the tourist site of Umm Qais or the city of Irbid. U.S. government personnel must also have permission for official travel on Highway 10 east of the town of Ruwayshid toward the Iraq border, or for official visits to refugee camps anywhere in Jordan. Personal travel by U.S. government employees to the border areas or refugee camps is not permitted. Police and security officials have arrested weapon and drug smugglers, as well as foreign fighters attempting to enter Syria to fight in the country’s ongoing conflict. In the past, fighting in Syria has occurred close to Syria’s border with Jordan, and some munitions have landed within Jordan’s borders. On June 21, 2016, ISIS conducted a car bombing attack against a Jordanian military facility in the country’s northeast, along the border with Syria, killing seven Jordanian soldiers. The Department of State warns against all travel into Syria and Iraq. Please see the Travel Advisories and Country Information for Syria and Iraq for further information. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.","Modern medical care and medicines are generally available in Jordan’s main cities but not always in outlying areas. Most acute and chronic medical conditions can be treated. When called, ambulances are often slow to arrive and personnel generally have only a basic level of training. Most hospitals in Jordan, especially in Amman, are privately owned. Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment or a high deposit for services. Seasonal dust storms that envelop the country for days or weeks each spring may significantly aggravate respiratory conditions such as asthma or sinus problems. For emergency services in Jordan, dial 911 . Ambulance services are not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Health Facilities in General: Adequate health facilities are available in Amman but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Medical staff may speak little or no English. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Jordan. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Jordan. Persons traveling to Jordan for medical purposes require the proper “medical” visa. Pharmaceuticals: Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy: Surrogacy is illegal in Jordan. Water Quality: In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Adventure Travel: Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel . Air Quality: The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the spring. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens People over 65 years of age People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema People with heart disease or diabetes People who work or are active outdoors Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. The Jordanian constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press with some restrictions. Insulting the King or members of the Royal Family may lead to detainment or imprisonment. Additionally, the Jordanian government considers proselytizing to Muslims (including the distribution of religious material) illegal, and anyone undertaking these activities is subject to prosecution, imprisonment, and deportation. Please see the information below on Islam as the state religion of Jordan. Jordanian courts may impose criminal penalties, including imprisonment, for alleged infractions that in the United States would be resolved in civil courts. The U.S. Embassy is aware of several cases involving business or financial disputes that resulted in lengthy pre-trial detention and imprisonment under local financial crimes laws. It is illegal to use, possess and/or distribute drugs, including marijuana and its derivatives, in Jordan. Jordan has strict drug laws and enforces them readily. Drug possession/use is one of the five main offenses that falls under the umbrella of the state security court and is subject to a different set of criminal procedures than other offenses. Accused offenders can be detained for up to two weeks without charges. In addition, after being referred to the state security public prosecutor, the accused offender can be detained for an additional 15 days renewable for further investigation, as long as the extension does not exceed a total of two months. This delay can result in the Embassy not being notified about the detainment because an official arrest has not taken place. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are a U.S citizen and are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Family Circumstances: The U.S. Embassy is aware of cases where U.S. citizens have been subject to domestic violence and abandonment by their spouses, including incidents of restrictions of movement through travel holds, loss of custody of children or forced marriage. Women and children should pay particular attention to any warning signs, including husbands or other family members withholding money or travel documents after arrival in Jordan. Cases of domestic violence should be reported to the Family Protection Department. Travelers should also be aware that U.S. laws cannot protect U.S. citizens when they are outside of the United States. Travel Holds: Under Jordanian law, any adult male may prevent his minor children from leaving Jordan by simply registering a hold on their travel with the Jordanian authorities. Adults may place travel holds on their spouses pursuant to a court order from a Jordanian court. Adult male relatives (uncles, brothers, grandfathers) may also petition Jordanian courts for a travel hold on their unmarried adult female relatives. Immigration officials may prevent minor children traveling with their mothers from departing Jordan without the father’s affirmative consent. This is possible even if the child or woman holds only U.S. nationality. Jordanian authorities consider disputes surrounding travel holds as private family matters, and the Embassy is extremely limited in its ability to intervene. Travel holds may only be removed by the person who placed them or by a court. Please see Jordan’s International Parental Child Abduction (IPCA) page for further information. Male Military Requirement: U.S. citizen males who also hold Jordanian citizenship may be subject to laws that impose military service obligations on Jordanians. Jordanian men under age 40 are required to register for service in the Jordanian military. Those subject to registration may be prevented from leaving Jordan until exit permission is obtained from appropriate Jordanian authorities. This permission is often granted to U.S. citizens, but may take some time to obtain and may be limited to a single exit. Dual Citizenship: The Government of Jordan considers U.S.-Jordanian dual nationals to be Jordanian citizens. Local authorities typically do not notify the U.S. Embassy of arrests, detentions, or accidents involving dual nationals. For this reason, dual nationals in particular should carry copies of their U.S. passports with them at all times so that evidence of their identity and U.S. citizenship is readily available for local authorities. For additional information, see our information on Dual Nationality . Customs: Jordanian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Jordan of items such as drugs, firearms, poisons, chemicals, explosives, pornographic materials, communications equipment, drones and antiquities, among other items. You should contact the Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Washington, D.C., or one of the Jordanian consulates in the United States, if you seek specific information regarding customs requirements. Please also refer to our Customs Information page for additional information. Unmanned Aerial Systems (Drones): Tourists’ use of smaller drones is becoming increasingly popular. However, drones are illegal for personal use in Jordan, and persons seeking to bring any drone into Jordan must first obtain pre-authorization and approval from authorities before entry and use. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad Islam is the state religion of Jordan. The Jordanian government generally does not interfere in religious practices. Some religious groups, however, cannot obtain legal recognition of their denominations. On official documents such as birth and wedding certificates, the Government of Jordan only allows affiliation with legally recognized faiths: Islam, certain Christian denominations, and Judaism. Not listing an affiliated faith or listing a faith outside those recognized by the government is generally not permitted. Activities such as proselytizing or encouraging conversion to any faith other than Islam are prohibited. U.S. citizens have been detained, arrested, denied re-entry and/or deported for discussing or trying to engage Jordanians in discussions about religion, even if such discussions also involve other activities, such as humanitarian aid. Jordanian officials may not warn individuals before a detention, arrest, denial of entry or deportation; any warnings received should be taken extremely seriously. LGBTI Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTI events in Jordan. However, laws against adultery or breaches of modesty may be used against LGBTI travelers. Public displays of affection between individuals in general, and especially of the same sex are not considered culturally acceptable. Foreigners exhibiting such behavior or expressing themselves outside of traditional gender norms in terms of dress or appearance may face greater risk of official and societal harassment and/or be targets of violence. Gay and lesbian Jordanians frequently hide their sexuality, even from family members. Family members who discover that a relative is LGBTI may target them for “honor” crimes. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance . While in Jordan, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what is found in the United States . Outside of a few upscale hotels in the capital, individuals with disabilities will find almost no accessible accommodations. Similarly, there are very few accessible restaurants, shops, or historical sites. Transportation is not accessible and sidewalks and crosswalks, even in the main cities, are not accessible. Handicap-accessible toilets and bathrooms, even in major hospitals, are generally not available. However, at least one local NGO ( accessiblejordan.com ) has created a website which reports accessibility of tourist sites and other locations in Jordan. Travelers who rely on special accessibility requirements or assistance are encouraged to research on-line before planning travel to Jordan. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: Women visiting and residing in Jordan have reported incidents of sexual harassment, stalking, indecent exposure, and assault. The Embassy continues to receive sporadic reports regarding incidents of harassment and sexual assaults involving taxis and taxi drivers. Some have included physical assaults. To reduce the likelihood of being victimized, women should take precautions such as avoiding travel to unfamiliar areas at night, traveling alone, and riding in the front seat of a taxi. Additionally, dress modestly when in public. Carrying a cell phone at all times is recommended. Immediately report any incidents to the Family Protection Department by calling 911. See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."

Crime: The most common crimes encountered by foreign visitors are purse snatching, pickpocketing, assaults, and robberies, although all of these incidents are rare. Be vigilant and do not carry large sums of money or valuables on the street. Financial fraud, such as ATM skimming, is prevalent. The police sometimes conduct identification checks in public areas. Police are not required to demonstrate probable cause to detain individuals. Upon request, you must produce either a passport or an Embassy or Consulate-certified copy of your passport. Kazakh security personnel may at times place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms and telephones may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. Harassment and extortion by imposters, genuine law enforcement, and other officials does occur. Never voluntarily give your wallet to anybody. If pressured by a police officer, tell the officer that you will report the behavior to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate and to the officer’s supervisors. Try to obtain the officer's name, badge number, and license plate number, and note where and when the incident happened. Do not use unmarked taxis. At the airport, do not leave with anyone who does not show pre-arranged identification, even if the person is holding a sign with your name.

Kenya,"You should review the Department of State’s Travel Advisory for Kenya before considering travel to Kenya. Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are using increasingly less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Terrorist threats remain high in Kenya. Terrorist attacks in Kenya have cumulatively resulted in the death and injury of hundreds of people, including foreigners. Attacks have occurred in periods leading up to and during religious holidays and days of national significance. However, an attack is possible at any time. Please note these recent events: In January 2020, terrorists attacked a U.S. Department of Defense facility on the coast, killing several individuals and destroying seven aircraft. In January 2019, a small bomb exploded in Nairobi’s Central Business District, slightly injuring two people. In January 2019, a terrorist attack on the Dusit D2 Hotel complex in the Westlands area of Nairobi resulted in the death of 21 people, including one U.S. citizen. In April 2019, two Cuban doctors were kidnapped from a rural area in Mandera County and were reportedly transported to Somalia. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Regions to Avoid : The northeastern Kenyan counties of Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, and the northeastern area of Marsabit (including the cities of El Wak, Wajir, Garissa, Mandera, Moyale, and Liboi). All parts of the coastal counties of Tana River and Lamu, and all areas of Kilifi County north of Malindi. The road between Kainuk and Lodwar in Turkana County due to banditry. The Nairobi neighborhoods of Eastleigh and Kibera. Avoid using the Likoni ferry due to safety and security concerns. Crime: Crime in Kenya is a regular occurrence and Kenyan authorities have limited capacity to deter and investigate such acts. Violent and sometimes fatal criminal attacks, including home invasions, burglaries, armed carjackings, muggings, and kidnappings can occur at any time. “Matatus” (privately-operated public transportation buses) tend to be targeted since they carry multiple passengers. Cases of violent street crime targeting Westerners occur in many seemingly safe areas of Nairobi, ranging from simple muggings to kidnapping and extortion, including attacks during daylight hours. U.S. citizens using off-the-street taxis have also been victims of robbery, kidnapping, and extortion. Forced Marriage is known to occur in Kenya. Female genital mutilation (FGM) and Cutting (C): This act is known to occur in Kenya. It is a federal crime to perform FGM/C in the United States on any minor younger than 18 years old, punishable by fines and up to five years in prison. It is also a criminal offense knowingly to take a minor younger than 18 years old outside of the United States for the purpose of performing FGM/C (so-called “vacation cutting”). Sexual Assault is prevalent in Kenya and frequently goes unreported. Victims of sexual assault may have difficulty receiving adequate social or medical support . While sexual assault is mostly frequently associated with women, sexual assault of men also occurs in Kenya and often goes unreported because of the stigma attached to this type of assault. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Kenya. Scams are often initiated through dating apps, internet postings/profiles, or by unsolicited emails and letters. Common scams include: Romance and online dating (Check this online dating scam infographic ). Someone you have not met in person quickly offers friendship, romance, and/or marriage. Job solicitations asking for a processing fee in advance. A person asking for money to pay hospital bills, visa fees, or legal expenses and/or seeming to have many sudden problems overseas. Elaborate scam business opportunities, including fraudulent government procurements. Recently, scammers have been impersonating legitimate companies and ordering commodities shipped through Mombasa with payment terms. Companies are encouraged to independently verify the purchasing company to confirm the order prior to shipping goods without pre-payment. Please contact the Commercial Section at Office.Nairobi@trade.gov for assistance verifying procurement opportunities and Kenyan buyers. Use good judgement and caution on social media and dating websites. If you decide to meet someone in person that you have connected with online, be sure to set up the meeting in a safe and public place, and let someone know where you are.

Kosovo,"For most visitors, Kosovo remains a safe country. Petty street crime is the most common safety concern for U.S. citizens. The Kosovo Police, assisted by the EU Rule of Law mission (EULEX) and the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR), are responsible for safety and security in Kosovo. The U.S. Embassy has no law enforcement authority. Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.  Exercise caution at festivals and other public events. If you are in a crowd and the security situation begins to deteriorate, leave the area immediately. Remain aware of your surroundings and have a plan for escape should an emergency arise. Monitor instructions from the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Travel by U.S. Embassy personnel to North Mitrovica, Leposavic, Zubin Potok, and Zvecan is restricted due to incidents of violence and high tensions in these areas. The U.S. government strongly advises private U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to these regions as well. The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens who encounter difficulties in these areas. Organized crime is present in Kosovo, occasionally resulting in violent confrontations between rival organizations. Most incidents are politically motivated and are not directed at tourists or foreigners. Sporting events may also trigger violence or protests. Celebratory gunfire and the use of low-quality fireworks are common during holidays and celebrations. Serious injuries and death have occurred as a result of stray bullets and accidents evolving fireworks. It is strongly advised to remain indoors when viewing fireworks displays. U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations , events involving political/ethnic/religious/social causes, or any other large groups. Demonstrations occur frequently, particularly in Pristina, often with little or no notice. Demonstrations can cause serious traffic disruptions or violent incidents. For more information, visit U.S. Embassy Kosovo’s alert and messages page . Crime : Although violent crime against U.S. citizens is rare, remain cognizant of your profile in public and avoid drawing attention to yourself as a U.S. citizen. Theft and other petty street crimes do occur, particularly in areas where tourists and foreigners congregate. Do not leave anything of value in plain view in unattended vehicles. Park your vehicles in a secure, off-street location. Street crime and home invasion occur with some frequency. Criminals target those appearing vulnerable and/or wealthy and use periods of reduced police availability (e.g., holidays, unrest, and major events such as elections) to commit crimes of opportunity. Securely lock the windows and doors of your residence when not home and set your home alarm, if you have one. Robberies , thefts , and burglaries often increase dramatically around the year-end holidays as criminals tend to target shoppers carrying cash and gifts and storing these items in their vehicles. If possible, avoid carrying and/or displaying large amounts of cash or packages. To avoid the risk of sexual assault , anyone traveling alone in taxis or mini-buses should exercise caution, especially after dark. Avoid being alone in isolated areas with unfamiliar people. Do not leave drinks unattended in bars and nightclubs. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Victims of crime and sexual assault should go to a safe location, call the local police to report the incident, and then contact the U.S. Embassy. Report crimes to the local police by dialing 192 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +383 (38) 5959-3000 (available 24/7 for emergencies). Police responsiveness to criminal reports varies greatly.

Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. The Kosovo criminal justice system does not function at a level consistent with Western standards. Lengthy detentions are common before and during judicial proceedings. The U.S. Embassy cannot expedite legal/court proceedings, secure releases, nor facilitate preferential conditions for detained U.S. citizens. Special Circumstances: Power outages, which can occur throughout Kosovo, may also disrupt other public utilities, including water service, and interfere with traffic lights, normal business activity, and public services. Kosovo is a cash economy based on the euro, although credit card use is increasingly prevalent. ATMs are readily available throughout Kosovo, and users should take normal precautions when using ATMs to safeguard their PIN. Be aware when using public Internet cafes and open WiFi connections, as your sensitive personal information, account passwords, etc. can be stolen. Travelers must complete a customs declaration at their port of entry when bringing in or taking out cash in amount of 10,000 euros or more. Failure to comply may result in the confiscation of a percentage of the funds. Potential for Natural Disasters: Kosovo is located in a seismically active area of the world making it susceptible to earthquakes. The best way to cope with an earthquake is to make preparations in advance. For information on what to do before and during a natural disaster, see: U.S. Embassy Kosovo website . U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides general information about natural disaster preparedness. U.S. Geological Survey provides updates on recent seismic and volcanic activity. Explosive devices: While de-mining programs have proven effective, unexploded ordnance and mines remain in some areas. Seek additional information for marked and unmarked contaminated areas with leftover mines and unexploded ordnances. Further, improvised explosive devices (IED) and Molotov cocktails have been used in Kosovo. Any suspicious item should be reported to the local authorities. Climbing and Hiking: For outdoor activities, you should seek a local guide’s informed advice, maintain communication with your family and friends, and provide route and contact details to someone not travelling with you. The weather in Kosovo can change quickly, even in the summer months. Temperatures can drop overnight and snow can fall unexpectedly. If in trouble, call the local emergency number at 112. Local authorities will help to the best of their ability. Athletes: We have received reports that some Kosovo sports clubs have allegedly not honored contracts for foreigners. Before signing a contract or relocating, ensure you are able to financially support your trip and return home to the United States, should problems arise. Property and Other Private or Commercial Disputes: The Government of the United States does not have jurisdiction over property or private disputes in Kosovo. The U.S. Embassy cannot protect personal property and cannot take sides in legal disputes. Information about the legal system in Kosovo is available on the Government of Kosovo Judicial Council (KJC) website. Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country report Human Rights Report – see country report Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTI events in Kosovo. LGBTI individuals are protected by anti-discrimination laws, and there are no legal impediments to organizing LGBTI events. In practice, however, LGBTI persons face discrimination. LGBTI travelers should exercise caution when visiting Kosovo, especially with regard to expressing affection in public. Despite existing legal protections, LGBTI travelers may find that individual police officers are unfamiliar, or have limited experience, with the needs or concerns of the LGTBI community. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance . Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from in the United States. The Kosovo Constitution and legislation prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, and in the provision of other state services. Only limited measures exist to support disabled persons. Law mandates access for disabled persons to official buildings; however, it is not enforced, and such access is rarely available. Most public buildings and many residential or commercial facilities remain inaccessible. Public transportation for persons with disabilities is very limited.

Arrest Notification: Laos does not routinely inform the U.S. Embassy of the arrest of U.S. citizens in a timely fashion and does not always allow consular access to arrested individuals. If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information Police and legal system bribes and informal procedures: It is common for police to target foreigners to pay bribes for alleged traffic offenses. The Embassy is not usually able to provide assistance in these cases. Foreigners arrested for unruly conduct or damaging private property will often be held in police custody without formal charges being brought against them until they pay an indemnity to the injured party. This process usually takes a minimum of two to three weeks. Relationships with Lao citizens: Lao law prohibits cohabitation or sexual contact between foreign citizens and Lao nationals except when the two parties have been married in accordance with Lao Family Law. Any foreigner who cohabitates with or enters into a sexual relationship with a Lao national risks being interrogated, detained, arrested, or fined. Foreigners are not permitted to invite Lao nationals of the opposite sex to their hotel rooms, and police may raid hotel rooms without notice or consent. Foreigners, including U.S. citizens of Lao descent, are not allowed to stay in the homes of Lao nationals, even family, without the prior consent of the village chief and local police. Foreigners who married a Lao national outside of Laos should have their marriage certificate authenticated at a Lao Embassy in the country where the marriage took place before traveling to Laos. Possession of, trafficking in, and manufacture of drugs are serious offenses in Laos and result in lengthy prison sentences or the death penalty.

Adventure Tourism: Laos has a developing adventure tourism industry that includes, but is not limited to, zip-lining, bungee jumping, rock climbing, and off-road bikes and buggies. Safety standards and training requirements for personnel operating these activities and safety inspections of the equipment may not be equivalent to those required for similar activities in the United States. We recommend that travelers check the safety records of adventure tourism operators. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about adventure travel . Water Safety: Travel by speedboat on rivers in Laos is dangerous, especially when water levels are low. White water rafting, kayaking, tubing, and other water-based activities, including swimming in the Mekong, are dangerous. Foreigners have drowned or been seriously injured. Do not participate in any water-based activities while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Please be aware that safety advice will be minimal, and there may not be warning signs at tourist sites.

Latvia,"Terrorism: Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks. However, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Crime against foreign visitors is generally non-violent in nature; however, violent assaults and robberies have occurred. Harassment of foreigners and same-sex partners has also occurred in Latvia. Be aware of your surroundings and take personal security measures to stay safe. The most common crimes encountered by foreign tourists are purse snatching, pick pocketing, and mugging, especially during the summer tourism season. Thieves have targeted foreign vistiors in Riga’s Old Town (Vecriga), Central Train Station (Dzelzcela stacija), Central Bus Station (Autoosta), and Central Market (Centraltirgus). Avoid walking alone or using ATMs after dark. There have been cases of visitors partying at bars and nightclubs in Riga who have been drugged and subsequently sexually assaulted. Be aware of other common scams in restaurants and tourist pubs. Pay special attention to drink prices, as they may rise to exorbitant levels for tourists. Management may use force to secure payment. Internet crime is increasing in Latvia.  Common schemes involve internet auction or job-search sites. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.

Outside of urban areas, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to provide assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","The quality of medical care in Latvia continues to improve but often falls short of Western standards. Latvia has highly trained medical professionals, but hospitals and clinics suffer from a lack of equipment and resources. Many doctors speak at least limited English. There are few private clinics in major cities that offer services equal to Western European or U.S. standards. Western-quality dental care can be obtained in Riga. Payment is expected upon admission at private hospitals. Prescription Medicines : Pharmaceuticals sold in Latvia are produced by companies certified in accordance with EU standards but may not be labeled the same as in the United States. For general emergency services in Latvia, dial 112. For medical emergency services, dial 113. Ambulance services are available in urban areas but not countrywide. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance in rural areas. We do not pay medical bills.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned or deported. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Latvia are severe. You can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. You can be jailed immediately for driving under the influence of alcohol. Your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. Special Circumstances: Latvia is part of the Eurozone and only euros are accepted. Bank and currency exchange counters may refuse to accept U.S. currency that is crumpled, torn, discolored, or defaced (even small pen strokes are considered defacing). If such notes are accepted for exchange, an additional processing fee, based on the size of the transaction, may be charged. Cashing personal and Treasury checks issued in the United States may be time-consuming and costly. ATMs are widely available in Riga and in major towns. For security purposes, it is recommended that visitors use ATMs located inside major hotels or shopping malls. Telephone connections with the United States are reliable; however, U.S. toll-free numbers cannot be accessed from Latvia. Customs: Latvian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Latvia of items such as firearms, religious materials, antiquities, medications, business equipment, drugs, etc. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Contact the Embassy of Latvia in Washington or one of the Latvian consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated good are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws.

See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of the Department of State's Human Rights Report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance : While in Latvia, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different than in the United States. The law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, and other state services, and the government generally enforces these provisions. The law mandates access to buildings for persons with disabilities; however, most buildings are not yet accessible. Although Latvia has made efforts to improve disabled access, only new and completely renovated hotels, guest houses, hostels, and public buildings provide suitable facilities for seriously disabled travelers. See our Traveling with Disabilities page. You may find general information on accessibility and accommodations on the website of the Latvian Tourism Board . You will rarely find easy-access public transportation and taxis. Free or reduced fares on public transportation are available only to persons with disabilities who are Latvian residents.

Lebanon,"Terrorism: Across the world, terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad and resort to various methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles  – frequently on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) In Lebanon, there is potential for death or injury because of terrorist attacks. Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Lebanon. ISIS and affiliated groups have claimed responsibility for suicide bombings in Lebanon. U.S. citizens have been the targets of terrorist attacks in Lebanon. The threat of anti-Western terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury to bystanders. Clashes between Lebanese authorities and criminal elements continue to occur in areas of the Bekaa Valley and border regions.  Hizballah maintains a strong presence in the Bekaa Valley, in addition to areas in southern Lebanon and south Beirut. In addition to the threat of Hizballah conducted terrorist activity, Hizballah has been the target of attacks by other extremist groups for their support of the Assad regime in Syria. Avoid the Lebanon-Syria border region: The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanese-Syrian border region because of past clashes, extremist activity, and the potential for these to recur at any time. Avoid the Lebanon-Israel border region: Hostilities flared in Southern Lebanon in April 2022, and again in April 2023, due to tensions between Israel, Hizballah, and the Palestinian terrorist group HAMAS. The potential for wider conflict remains. The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanon-Israel border area due to ongoing tensions between the two countries. Attacks and responses can occur without warning. Landmines and unexploded ordnance pose significant dangers throughout southern Lebanon, particularly south of the Litani River. Travelers should watch for posted landmine warnings and strictly avoid all marked areas. Avoid travel to refugee settlements: Violence within refugee settlements has resulted in shootings and explosions. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to refugee settlements. Palestinian groups hostile to both the Lebanese government and the United States operate autonomously in formal and informal refugee settlements in different areas of the country. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Reported crime rates in Lebanon are moderate but rising. Violent crime and sexual assault are rare but do occur. Petty theft -- such as pickpocketing and purse snatching -- occurs in crowded public areas. More recently, the dire economic situation is engendering a significant increase in economically motivated crimes, including home invasions and car thefts. Police are responsive but often unable to affect a positive outcome. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Protests often occur spontaneously with little to no advance warning. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Lebanon. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Lotteries Work permits/job offers See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault or domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Lebanon can be significant, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Visitors lacking passport or identification documents at government checkpoints are subject to questioning by Lebanese authorities. In certain areas, taking photos of buildings or other infrastructure has led to questioning and detention. In Lebanon, persons driving under the influence can be jailed immediately.

Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Individuals who were affiliated with the former militia known as the South Lebanon Army (SLA) and previously departed Lebanon because of their association with that group should carefully consider any plans to return to Lebanon.

Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: LGBTQI+ status and/or conduct is criminalized in Lebanon, and LGBTQI+ persons can face significant social stigma. Article 534 of the Lebanese Penal Code prohibits sexual relations, “contradicting the laws of nature,” an offense punishable by up to one year in prison. Although Lebanese courts have interpreted this provision in different ways and prosecutions are rare, judicial decisions can vary case-to-case and LGBTQI+ adults have been charged, tried, and convicted for engaging in consensual same-sex relations. Authorities have arrested LGBTQI+ individuals for minor offenses, then charged them with violation of Article 534 when evidence of their LGBTQI+ identity is uncovered, through searches of cell phones or other personal material. While prosecution is uncommon, short-term detentions can expose individuals to discrimination and abuse. There has been a rise in anti-LGBTQI+ rhetoric from political and religious leaders, accompanied by an increase in online harassment, threats of violence, and violence against LGBTQI+ persons. In August 2023, members of an anti-LGBTQI+ religious group attacked an LGBTQI+ friendly establishment in the Mar Mikhael neighborhood of Beirut, reportedly threatening, assaulting, and injuring patrons. Gatherings, events, or items (including those with rainbows) perceived as “promoting homosexuality” have the potential of being scrutinized, monitored or disbanded by security forces. While Lebanese authorities indicate that travelers entering Lebanon with passports showing X gender will be admitted without difficulty, the United States government cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights Report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Lebanon prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is unevenly enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is relatively low. Some facilities and information have been made accessible, but such standard accessibility is not common. Expect infrastructure accessibility to be limited in urban areas, and even more so in the rest of the country. There are a handful of hotels that are partially accessible in the Beirut area. Some transportation companies do provide accessible services. Events and activities are rarely designed to be inclusive. Service providers for people with disabilities, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants, are available but limited in Lebanon. The best way to find assistance is to contact organizations for people with disabilities such as the Lebanese Union for Persons with Physical Disabilities, the Youth Association of the Blind, the Lebanese Federation of the Deaf, or the Lebanese Association for Self Advocacy. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Exit Bans: U.S. citizens living in or traveling in Lebanon are sometimes denied permission to depart the country because a criminal, civil, or family court has imposed an exit ban. For example, a head of household can place an exit ban against a spouse and children even before the family arrives in Lebanon. Easily initiated, exit bans remain in place for prolonged periods and can only be removed by petition from an attorney. The U.S. Embassy cannot have exit bans removed, even in times of crisis. An attorney’s list is available on U.S. Embassy Beirut’s website . Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Dual Citizenship: U.S. citizens who also hold Lebanese nationality are considered by local authorities to be Lebanese, even when entering Lebanon using a U.S. passport. Lebanese-U.S. citizens who are suspected of association with Israeli citizens or officials, or to have traveled through Israel, are subject to detention, arrest, and prosecution. Their passports may be retained by Lebanese authorities on arrival, and they must appear at the Lebanese Military court the next business day for investigation, after which their passports may be returned if no connections with Israel are confirmed. U.S. citizen dual nationals of other Arab countries who arrive at a Lebanese point of entry with an Israeli stamp in their passports will be denied entry and may be detained or arrested. Travelers with a family name deemed to be of Israeli or Jewish origin may also be questioned or detained. Travelers who have previously entered Lebanon illegally under Lebanese law, whether as refugees or for transit to a third country, may be denied entry, even if they are or have since become U.S. citizens. Middle Eastern Heritage: U.S. citizens with names reflecting Middle Eastern heritage may face additional scrutiny at Lebanese ports of entry and may be required to show documentary evidence of their parentage: specifically, official proof of their father’s name such as a copy of their birth certificate. Marrying in Lebanon: More than 18 separate and distinct religious sects solemnize marriages in Lebanon. Civil marriage is not available. U.S. citizen and Lebanese national couples should familiarize themselves with the rights and responsibilities of marriage as defined by the religion performing their marriage. They should be aware that religious clerics and religious courts dictate all personal status matters related to marriage, divorce, and child custody. In matters of marriage, child custody, inheritance, and divorce, personal status laws provide unequal treatment across the various confessional court systems but generally discriminate against women.  Nationality law also discriminates against women, who may not confer citizenship to their spouses and children. Civil marriages performed outside of Lebanon and registered with Lebanon’s Ministry of the Interior fall under civil court jurisdiction regarding divorce and child custody. Military Service Obligation: Mandatory military service in Lebanon was abolished in 2007. However, travelers with questions about prior military service, desertion, or failure to register in the past should contact the Embassy of Lebanon in Washington, D.C. for details prior to traveling to Lebanon. Customs: Lebanese customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning import and export of items, such as firearms, military paraphernalia, professional camera equipment, other communications equipment, or antiquities. You should contact the Embassy of Lebanon in Washington, D.C., for specific information regarding customs requirements. Please see our information on customs regulations ."

There is a small private hospital, Maseru Private Hospital, which has thirty-two available beds, a small operating theater, radiology, and lab services. However, the facility is under-utilized by residents because of the excessive cost of care. As a result, services there are unreliable, with the x-ray equipment frequently being out of order and a constant change over in staff.

Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Altitude: Many cities in Lesotho, are at high altitude. Beware of the symptoms of altitude sickness, and take precautions before you travel. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Travel to High Altitudes . General Health Language: Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays. HIV/AIDS: Lesotho has one of the highest HIV rates in the world. Approximately one-quarter of the adult population of Lesotho is infected with HIV. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in Lesotho. Air Quality: Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Lesotho. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens People over 65 years of age People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. People with heart disease or diabetes People who work or are active outdoors","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Extreme weather preparation: Visitors to the interior of Lesotho should bring clothing and equipment suitable for extreme cold weather during the winter months of June through August. Weather conditions can deteriorate rapidly in the mountains, and snow may close mountain passes. Temperatures can drop below freezing even in the lowlands. Lesotho has one of the highest rates of lightning strikes per square mile in the world, and lightning-related deaths are not uncommon. If you find yourself in a storm, find shelter in a building or car. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information.

There is no explicit prohibition of consensual same-sex sexual relations between women. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: The Buildings Control Act of 1995 requires that all buildings be made accessible, but enforcement thus far has been negligible. There are no mandatory standards of accessibility for sidewalks, road crossings, public transportation, and parking areas. There are no free or reduced fares for transport, and very few accessible places of lodging, medical facilities, restaurants, cafes, or bars. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips. Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Gender-based violence (GBV) is at epidemic levels in Lesotho, with one in three women and girls reporting abuse by an intimate partner (UNAIDS). Women should remain vigilant when traveling in Lesotho and should avoid traveling alone if possible."
Liberia,"Liberia's police force has limited resources. The Liberia National Police have a strong presence in Monrovia, but less of a presence outside of the capital city. The police can be both a source of assistance and a source of problems for visitors. Travelers may be detained by police officers soliciting bribes. You are encouraged to carry a photocopy of your passport with you at all times as proof of identity and citizenship. If detained or arrested, you should ask to contact the U.S. Embassy immediately. You should be aware of your surroundings at all times and use caution when moving around, especially at night. Travel outside of Monrovia after dark is strongly discouraged, as roads are in poor condition and there are few public street lights. U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling outside the capital or between counties after dark (with the exception of travel to and from Roberts International Airport). Avoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations, and maintain security awareness. Crime: Crimes of opportunity, such as residential burglary or armed robbery (typically using a knife or machete) have affected U.S. citizens and are more common at night. Criminal activity has been reported in both urban and rural areas, including public beaches. The Liberia National Police have limited capacity to respond to crime events. The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Liberia is also 911. However, emergency services are not provided reliably or consistently. Also, there is no landline telephone service in Liberia, and cellular phone communication is subject to occasional disruptions in service. A call to 911 in Liberia may go unanswered, and you should employ other resources to obtain emergency assistance. Corruption: Corruption is rampant. Poorly paid government officials and private company employees may ask for “fees” for doing their job, and travelers may be inconvenienced for not paying bribes. Requesting official signed receipts for the payment of any unexpected “fines” or “fees” can sometimes deter such improper behavior. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. While infrequent, the police may use tear gas. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Scams: Internet romance and financial scams occur in Liberia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should seek medical assistance as needed and contact the U.S. Embassy as soon as possible. Report crimes to the local police in person or at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at + (231) 77-677-7000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. We can: help you find appropriate medical care assist you in reporting a crime to the police contact relatives or friends, with your written consent explain the local criminal justice process in general terms provide a list of local attorneys provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S. provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution help you find accommodation and arrange flights home replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance as many medical procedures are not available in Liberia. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.","Hospitals and medical facilities in Liberia are poorly equipped and are incapable of providing many services. Emergency services comparable to those in the United States or Europe are non-existent, and the blood supply is unreliable and unsafe for transfusion. For serious medical problems, you should consider traveling to the United States, Europe, or South Africa for treatment. Within Liberia, medicines are scarce, often beyond expiration dates, possibly counterfeit, and generally unavailable in most areas. Malaria and yellow fever are prevalent throughout the country. Yellow fever immunization is required to enter Liberia and recommended for all residents. Chemoprophylaxis (anti-malarial medication) is recommended for all travelers, even for short stays. You should: Carry and use insect repellents containing either 20 percent DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535. Treat clothing and tents with permethrin. Sleep in screened or air-conditioned rooms under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Emergency services are absent or are unreliable in most areas. Some medical facilities in Monrovia do have ambulances but they use these vehicles primarily for patient transport. Emergency services such as those in the United States do not exist in Liberia. Ambulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Ambulances are not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of Liberia to ensure the medication is legal in Liberia. Always, carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. The following diseases and medical hazards are prevalent: Malaria Yellow Fever Typhoid Hepatitis A, B, and C Rabies Diarrheal Illnesses Tuberculosis Schistosomiasis Onchocerciasis Lassa Fever Rickettsial Infections Snake Bites Sexually Transmitted Infections Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Liberia are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Photographs: Photographing military installations, air and sea ports, and important government buildings is prohibited. You should not take photographs of sites or activities that may be considered sensitive, as police may confiscate the camera. Infrastructure: Lodging, fuel, transportation, utilities, and telephone services are not consistently available, especially outside of Monrovia. Hotel rooms can be difficult to find without an advance reservation. There is no working landline telephone system in Liberia. You should rent or purchase a local cellular phone. Commercial air courier service is available. Financial Issues: The Liberian dollar is the official currency; however, the U.S. dollar is accepted as legal tender. Liberian dollars are preferred for smaller purchases, especially outside of Monrovia. Wire transfers may be limited and subject to fees if you do not have a Liberian bank account. ATMs are not widely available. Due to a cash shortage in Liberia’s banking sector, it is difficult to obtain adequate cash supplies – both Liberian and U.S. dollars – from ATMs and banks. Traveler's checks and credit cards are not regularly accepted, except at some major hotels in Monrovia. There have been some reports of financial information being compromised even at hotels where credit cards are routinely accepted; always keep your credit card in sight. Swimming Hazards: Do not swim alone or after dark and do not walk on any beach after dark. Travelers should seek out and heed posted warnings and refrain from bathing at unmarked, unpatrolled beaches. Do not swim in the Atlantic Ocean if you are unfamiliar with swimming in water where very strong rip currents occur. Riptides can occur anywhere on the coast. The Liberia Weather Service does not provide information on where and when these tides form, and there are no lifeguards posted on beaches. In some areas, the water may be contaminated with sewage. Avoid use of alcohol or mind-altering drugs while engaging in water sports. Avoid water where sewage contamination or algae are present. Avoid any exposure (rafting, swimming, or wading) in water known to be infected with schistosomiasis (bilharzia). Scuba dive only with personnel certified by the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) or the National Associated of Underwater Instructors (NAUI); use equipment only from PADI- or NAUI-certified dive operators. Follow established timetables for air travel after diving. The time from the end of the dive until the boarding of an aircraft is generally between 12 and 24 hours, depending on the type of dive. Decline water transportation in vessels without personal flotation devices or life jackets. Wear appropriate footwear when walking, wading, or swimming to avoid injury and exposure to parasites and poisonous plants and animals. Risk from jellyfish exists, including highly venomous Portuguese man-of-war. Travelers wading, launching boats, or fishing are especially at risk. Risk from coral, stonefish, and sea urchins exists. Sit on a towel, blanket, or piece of clothing if a chair or hammock is not available because sand may be contaminated in areas frequented by animals. Thoroughly shake out all fabrics after use. Avoid eating amberjack, bonito, mackerel, mahi-mahi, or tuna due to risk of scombroid poisoning. Low risk of ciguatera poisoning exists in coastal areas and is presumed to have widespread distribution. Travelers should also avoid consumption of reef fish such as amberjack, barracuda, grouper, and snapper. The toxin remains even when these fish are well cooked. Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: Consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Liberia. Voluntary sodomy is a first-degree misdemeanor with penalties ranging up to one year in prison. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Liberia prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, and the law is enforced to the extent possible. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is reported as comparable to the United States due to the visibility of people who are living with injuries sustained in the civil wars or from polio. Expect accessibility to be limited or nonexistent in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Individuals may be able to purchase second-hand equipment from street markets. Durable medical equipment stores do not exist in Liberia; therefore, anyone who needs equipment or devices should bring them to Liberia. Liberia does not provide hearing aids or repair of hearing aids. Services such as sign language are very limited and only available in Monrovia. Additionally, Liberia does not have an agency that trains or staffs personal assistants for those with disabilities. Individuals needing a personal care assistant would need to hire and train the personal care assistant. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: Rape is a crime in Liberia punishable by up to life in prison. However, the Liberian government does not effectively enforce the law, and rape is a serious and pervasive problem. Domestic violence also remains a serious problem despite being punishable by up to six months in prison. Although female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) was banned by a proclamation of the National Council of Chiefs and Elders in 2023, it is not specifically against the law in Liberia. See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Libya,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) The following groups, which are on the U.S. government’s list of designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations , pose a high risk to U.S. citizens in the region: The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS)-Libya Al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) Terrorist attacks have occurred in Libya and the surrounding region.

Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration. Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis for assistance. Victims of sexual assault have little recourse in Libya, and women who report sexual crimes may be accused of adultery and are at risk of further violence against them if they are unable to prove that a crime occurred under a high standard of proof in the Libyan judicial system. Victims may wish to report crimes to the local police station closest to where they are residing and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(216) 71-107-000, or +216 29 980 978 for WhatsApp calling capabilities.

In Libya: You may be detained for questioning if you do not have your passport with you. It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings, especially military and government facilities. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Driving under the influence can result in immediate detention. Alcohol is also prohibited, and possessing, using, or trafficking in alcohol can carry severe penalties. Customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning the introduction into Libya or removal from Libya of firearms, religious materials, antiquities, medications, and currency. The importation and consumption of alcohol, pornography, and pork products are illegal. Furthermore, certain acts of U.S. citizens overseas are prosecutable as crimes in the United States even if they are not illegal under the local law ..  For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask for police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy in Tunis immediately. See our webpage for further information. If you are detained in Libya, the Department of State may not be notified of your detention, and Department of State officials cannot visit you, due to security reasons throughout the country and the suspended operating status of the U.S. Embassy in Libya.  Since most law enforcement is currently performed by militias, there are few clear legal processes.  During your detention, you may not be provided with basic toiletries or appropriate nutrition. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods also may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website and U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Dual Nationality: U.S. citizens of Libyan origin may also be subject to laws that impose special obligations on Libyan citizens. The Government of Libya considers all children born to Libyan fathers to be Libyan citizens, even if they were not issued a Libyan birth certificate or a Libyan passport. Dual Libyan-American nationals may not enter or leave Libya on their U.S. passports and must obtain a Libyan travel document before traveling to Libya. Persons with dual nationality who travel to Libya on their Libyan passports are normally treated as Libyan citizens by the local government. The U.S. Department of State’s ability to provide U.S. consular assistance to those traveling on Libyan passports is extremely limited. For additional information, please see our information on dual nationality . Faith-Based Travelers: Proselytizing is illegal in Libya. Penalties are severe.

Women Travelers: Women and girls in Libya, particularly those with relatives of Libyan origin, as well as other Western travelers, are at increased risk of forced marriage, abduction, and kidnapping in Libya. Women travelling alone or with children, including Westerners and U.S. citizens, have been stopped, questioned, or harassed by authorities for travelling without a male guardian throughout Libya or when attempting to exit the country.  Male guardianship is not mandatory under current Libyan law, but Libyan authorities frequently require it.  Women and men travelling together may be asked to provide a marriage certificate to verify their relationship. Even when accompanied by a male guardian, women have been intimidated, threatened, and detained by armed militias, extremists, or other individuals for “un-Islamic” behavior.  Women are expected to wear clothing that meets strict modesty standards and may be stopped or harassed if they are dressed in a manner that is deemed immodest.  Women and girls who have been detained in Libya also report being victims of acts of sexual violence inflicted by authorities and/or militia members. Victims of sexual assault have little recourse in Libya, and women who report sexual crimes may be accused of adultery and are at risk of further violence against them if they are unable to prove that a crime occurred under a high standard of proof in the Libyan judicial system.

Macedonia,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) North Macedonia has not had any recent terrorist events, though there were some significant terrorism-related arrests in recent years.  There are continuing concerns in the region of returning Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs) and the potential for radicalization to violence.  North Macedonia authorities assess that ISIS members and sympathizers maintain a presence in North Macedonia. In the past year, during a six month period, North Macedonia was subject to false bomb threats to local schools, transportation hubs, commercial centers, and hotels. Though all threats were found to be false, local authorities responded to every threat and continue to investigate the threats’ origin. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Violent crime against U.S. citizens is rare. Theft and other petty street crimes do occur, particularly in areas where tourists and foreigners congregate. Do not leave anything of value in plain view in unattended vehicles. Securely lock the windows and doors of your residence when not at home. Organized crime is present in North Macedonia, and violent confrontations between rival organizations occasionally occur. ATM use is generally safe; however, take standard safety precautions and be aware of your surroundings. Pickpockets are a problem in crowded areas of Skopje.

Be aware that some hotels, resorts, etc. have exclusive agreements with medical providers, which may limit your choices in seeking emergency medical attention. Medical staff may speak little or no English. Generally, in public hospitals, only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations.  Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on Medical Tourism and the risks of medical tourism. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in North Macedonia. Although North Macedonia has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely.  If you plan to undergo surgery in North Macedonia, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available , and professionals are accredited and qualified. Persons traveling to North Macedonia for medical purposes require the proper “medical” visa.  Check the Government of North Macedonia’s website for more information. Pharmaceuticals Always carry your prescription medicine in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Republic of North Macedonia Customs Administration to ensure the medication is legal in North Macedonia. Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas.  Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients.  Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States.  Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States.  Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States.  Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy If you are considering traveling to North Macedonia to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our ART and Surrogacy Abroad page . If you decide to pursue parenthood in North Macedonia via assisted reproductive technology (ART) with a gestational mother, be prepared for long and unexpected delays in documenting your child’s citizenship. Surrogacy is legal in North Macedonia, but there are strict procedures that should be followed and individuals who attempt to circumvent local law may face criminal prosecution.  For additional information, consult the Ministry of Health’s website, available in the Macedonian language only. Water Quality In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested.  Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Adventure Travel Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel . Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in North Macedonia. Air Quality Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in North Macedonia. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons.  It is typically at its worst in the winter season. Air pollution levels in Skopje are between two and three times those of the most polluted areas in the United States. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens. People over 65 years of age. People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. People with heart disease or diabetes. People who work or are active outdoors.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. North Macedonia’s customs authorities enforce strict regulations that require special licenses or permits for the exportation of items deemed to be of historical value or significance. Taking such items out of North Macedonia without the appropriate government-issued permit can result in arrest, monetary fines, and prison sentences. North Macedonia's Customs Administration provides more information on customs regulations. Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as having military or security interest may result in problems with authorities. Visitors should comply with “no photography” signs. If you are in doubt, ask for permission before taking photographs. While larger stores and restaurants accept credit cards, small establishments may not accept credit cards and it is advised to carry cash in local currency (denar). Failure to declare currency exceeding 10,000 euros, or the equivalent, may result in its confiscation and a court proceeding. Penalties typically include a fine and a percentage of the undeclared amount. Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad Note: North Macedonia is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious, and multi-lingual state. While there is little religious/ethnic violence in North Macedonia, inter-ethnic and inter-religious tensions do exist. LGBTQI+ Travelers: Although same-sex relationships are not illegal in North Macedonia, LGBTQI+ individuals still face significant discrimination.  There are no openly gay-friendly establishments in the country. Civil society organizations have reported a recent increase in transphobic and homophobic speech, and there have been numerous reported instances of physical violence against LGBTQI+ individuals.  We advise exercising caution when attending LGBTQI+ events. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities/Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from the United States. North Macedonia’s law requires that only new buildings be accessible to persons with disabilities. Most public buildings are inaccessible and inconsistent inspection results in construction of new facilities that are not accessible. Public transportation for persons with disabilities is very limited. Although all buses the government has purchased for Skopje since 2013 have been accessible to persons with disabilities, public transportation remains largely inaccessible in other regions.

Madagascar,"Civil unrest, such as protests, is common in Madagascar. Be especially vigilant in the vicinity of downtown Antananarivo especially near government buildings, the national stadium, and historical monuments, where violent incidents have occurred. Violent confrontations between the dahalo (criminal gangs that steal cattle) and security forces have increased in several regions of Madagascar, particularly in areas south and west of the capital. Often precipitated by rumors or allegations of injuries to local citizens especially in areas where there are minimal security forces, mob violence and “popular justice” continues but is rarely directed toward foreign nationals. Street altercations and traffic accidents often quickly draw large and sometimes unruly crowds. Exercise caution and remain calm if you find yourself in a dispute, particularly in a public place. If you feel threatened by large crowds, immediately leave the scene, seek the direct intervention of local law enforcement, and contact the U.S. Embassy. The cyclone season in Madagascar occurs between December and April. Please monitor media reports, the RSMC Tropical Cyclone Center , and follow all official instructions. Exercise Increased Caution Due to Possible Protests and Civil Unrest Related to Presidential Election The official campaign season for Madagascar’s presidential election has begun. The first round of voting is scheduled for November 16. A second round, if necessary, is scheduled for December 20. Opposition candidates have already called for and staged large-scale protests in the capital, Antananarivo, resulting in violent confrontations with law enforcement. Such protests may continue throughout the election period and may escalate and expand geographically as the candidates begin to campaign throughout the country. Given the increased possibility of protests and civil unrest, we urge U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution and enroll in STEP to ensure access to security alerts sent by the Embassy. We also advise U.S. citizens that domestic flights in Madagascar are frequently subject to last-minute cancellations that can leave travelers stranded in remote areas without assistance. Tsaradia, Madagascar’s state-owned domestic airline, has a monopoly on domestic commercial flights and is notorious for last-minute cancellations and rescheduling, with no recourse for stranded travelers. Those who book Tsaradia flights through a third-party may not receive any advance notice of such cancellations and rescheduling. Regional airports in Madagascar receive little traffic and will close completely if the Tsaradia flight(s) for the day is cancelled. In such an event, there are no airline personnel present to assist stranded travelers. We recommend that travelers make contingency plans for lodging and local transportation in case their flight is cancelled or rescheduled at the last minute. CRIME: Petty crime in Madagascar is common in urban areas. Skilled pickpockets are very active in downtown Antananarivo, and they primarily target jewelry, purses, and mobile phones. Additionally, criminals have stolen luggage from baggage claim areas at Antananarivo’s Ivato International Airport by simply grabbing items off the conveyor belt and exiting the airport. Serious crimes, including home invasions, armed attacks, robberies, and assaults, are common in Madagascar. U.S. Embassy personnel are instructed not to use taxi-bes (minibuses which operate within urban centers) and taxi-brousses (which travel to outlying regions) due to the risk of carjacking and highway robbery. The majority of reported crimes were directed at Malagasy nationals but Westerners have likewise been targeted. Avoid walking alone especially after dark. Do not display cash and valuables. Drive with doors locked and windows closed. Always carry a color photocopy of your U.S. passport and visa. Keep original documents in a secure location. Most Malagasy authorities will accept a color photo copy, but you may be requested to present the original. Violent crime, such as armed robbery and assaults, is common in: Toamasina and Mahajanga Nosy Be Ankarana and Montagne d’Ambre National Parks adjacent to Diego Isalo area surrounding Tolagnaro (Ft. Dauphin) Batteie Beach, north of Toliara (Tuléar) Visiting remote sites: While the government has increased the number of dedicated police units at popular tourist sites, only visit remote sites in large groups guided by reputable tour operators. Exercise caution when traveling through these designated areas due to violent highway robberies: The general area south of the National Route (RN) 7 and RN 27 including the RN 10, RN 13, and the surrounding areas. Except the tourist area on the coastal roads between Ambovombe and Farafangana, including Fort Dauphin/Tolagnaro area. The RN 1B, which is located to the west of Antananarivo between Tsiroanomandidy and Maintirano. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 117, 22-227-35, or 22-357-09/10. U.S. citizens can also call the U.S. Embassy at (261) 20-23-480-00 if assistance is needed in communicating with law enforcement officials.

Tourism : The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.","Consult the CDC website for Madagascar prior to travel. Plague is endemic on the island, where outbreaks have resurfaced nearly every year since 1980. U.S. citizens visiting Madagascar are urged to monitor public health announcements from the Ministry of Public Health and the World Health Organization, and to follow public health guidelines and recommendations. Plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics, but it is crucial to seek medical treatment immediately, if you experience any plague signs or symptoms. See the List of Health Care Providers on the Embassy Antananarivo web page. You are responsible for all medical costs. U.S. Medicare does not cover you overseas. Medical Insurance: If your health insurance plan does not provide coverage overseas, we strongly recommend supplemental medical insurance and medical evacuation plans .

Visa overstays are a violation of local laws and U.S. citizens who overstay their visas will be subject to fines and potential prosecution. Exporting Gemstones/Precious Materials: The Government of Madagascar restricts the export of precious gems. Before purchasing or transporting gemstones, seek clarification of the applicable laws. Any precious materials should be accompanied by a certificate of authenticity and a certificate to allow for exportation from Madagascar. Currency: Madagascar is primarily a cash economy. Although some high-end establishments accept credit cards (normally only Visa-network cards), most shops and restaurants are cash only. Although the government changed the local currency from the Malagasy franc (FMG) to the ariary in 2005, many Malagasy still think in terms of FMG. When discussing prices, you should quantify whether the price is in ariary or FMG (1 Ariary = 5 FMG). ATMs, which generally accept Visa-network cards only, are available in large cities. Dollars are not widely accepted, and $100 bills are frequently refused at banks and local businesses.

Penalties can include imprisonment and fines. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: There is ample public transportation, but entering and exiting vehicles is precarious, and they are not equipped to accommodate passengers with disabilities. Vehicles are often still in motion as passengers enter and exit. There are no sidewalks in the vast majority of the country, and the roads are hazardous for foot travel with swerving vehicles and uneven surfaces. There are no pedestrian crossing signs or designated pathways, and crossing any street involves an element of risk. Pedestrian injuries are common. Public spaces are not wheelchair-accessible.

Malawi,"See the Department of State Travel Advisory and Alerts for Malawi. Demonstrations sometimes occur. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays or election dates, or during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Looting is common along protest routes. Be aware of tear gas and other riot control measures. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Both spontaneous and planned civil disturbances and demonstrations, primarily related to governance and economic issues, can occur. U.S. citizens should avoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations, and maintain security awareness at all times. CRIME : Crime is common in Malawi. Most crimes against U.S. citizens involve property. Residential break-ins are frequent; perpetrators are usually well armed and may become violent with little provocation. Petty street crime (robbery and pickpocketing) is common, and break-ins have occurred in hotels and lodges throughout the country. Kidnappings occur and non-Malawians have been targeted in Zomba. Carjackings occur, especially in Lilongwe and Blantyre. Carjackers often block the rear of a victim’s vehicle while it waits to pass through a security gate into a residence and then assailants threaten the driver and take the car. Victims are often assaulted. Drivers are advised to lock their car doors, close their windows, and remain vigilant when entering or exiting a residence. When traveling, ensure your windows are up and doors are locked. You should avoid traveling on foot at night, especially in urban areas, as armed muggings and assaults have occurred. Non-Malawians have been targeted in Lilongwe, and several U.S. citizens have been injured. City streets should be considered unsafe after dark even when walking in a large group. Pedestrians should also be cautious during daylight hours. Visitors in need of transportation should request that hotel or restaurant management call a taxi or car service. The capacity and availability of public security forces is limited, we recommend you use caution when visiting and/or especially when staying in less populated areas such as the Mount Mulanje region .

Malaysia,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Malaysia remains a transit point and, to a lesser extent, a destination country for members of terrorist groups including ISIS, Abu Sayyaf Group, al-Qa’ida, and Jemaah Islamiyah.  Information from credible sources suggests that there is a continued risk of armed terrorist and criminal groups operating and planning attacks against foreigners, including U.S. citizens, in the East Asian and Pacific region, including Malaysia.  Since 2013, Malaysian authorities have arrested more than 500 supporters of ISIS, including many individuals who planned to fight in Syria and Iraq. Use caution in eastern Sabah because of the threat of kidnappings-for-ransom and violence from both terrorist and criminal groups, including the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf Group (see the Philippines Travel Advisory for more information ).  In addition to targeting coastal or resort islands themselves, criminal or terrorist groups may attempt to intercept boats ferrying tourists from the mainland to resort islands. Due to safety concerns, U.S. government employees traveling for both personal and official travel to Sabah east of the north-south line drawn from the cities of Kudat to Tawau, including all islands, must obtain official written permission from the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur.  The exceptions are the cities of Sandakan, Lahad Datu, Tawau, the Sepiloolik Nature Reserve, and the Kinabatangan River areas, which require U.S. government employees to officially notify the Embassy prior to travel. Malaysian law enforcement officials have enacted land and water-based curfews in the coastal areas of eastern Sabah.  Check local media or ask local police for the most recent curfew information if traveling to eastern Sabah. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Petty theft and violent crime in Kuala Lumpur continue to be concerns. Purse snatchings, pickpocketing, smash-and-grab thefts from vehicles, and residential burglaries are the most common crimes committed against both locals and foreigners.  Avoid wrapping purse straps around arms or shoulders to avoid injury.  Violent and more serious crimes are less common; however, in October 2022, following local media reports of an increase in violent crime in the area of 430-440 Jalan Tun Razak, which houses multiple bars, clubs, and restaurants, the Embassy has advised U.S. government employees visiting establishments in this general vicinity to depart the neighborhood no later than 9:00 pm. Taxi drivers in central Kuala Lumpur have perpetrated violent crimes against foreign tourists and local residents.  Use e-hailing services or book taxis in downtown shopping areas by phone or online, rather than hailing a taxi on the street, particularly after dark. Criminals also target motorists stuck in traffic or stopped at a light with smash and grab robberies.  Keep valuables out of sight while driving or remove them from the car (including from the trunk) when parked.  GPS devices should not be left on the windshield or dashboard. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Local law pertaining to peaceful assembly prohibits non-Malaysians from participating in public protests. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Sophisticated internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Malaysia.  Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or, less frequently, by unsolicited emails, letters, text messages, and messages on social media.  Scammers frequently pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.  Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Contracts with promises of large commissions Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.  Report crimes to the local police via the emergency line at 999 (landline) or 112 (cell/mobile).  Alternatively, call the Royal Malaysia Police (RMP) Operations Center in Kuala Lumpur, 03-2115-9999 or 03-2266-2222 for advice on how to make a non-emergency police report.  Contact the U.S. Embassy at +(60) (3) 2168-5000 for assistance.  A police report is necessary for the Embassy to help victims follow up on incidents of crime.  In some tourist areas, the police have established small ""Tourist Police” stations manned by personnel familiar with helping visitors to Malaysia.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting a crime.

Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance, and first responder capabilities may vary.  When participating in trekking or other activities in extremely remote areas, particularly in the eastern states of Sabah and Sarawak on the island of Borneo, it may be difficult for first responders to reach patients quickly. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.","For emergency services in Malaysia, dial 999 (landline) or 112 (cell/mobile).  Callers to 999 emergency number are directed to whichever government hospital the dispatcher chooses. Ambulance services are: Widely available but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance (45+min). We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.  Malaysian hospitals will not bill your insurance directly.  You must provide payment and seek reimbursement. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.  Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental MEDEVAC insurance to cover medical evacuation. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.  Check with the Royal Malaysian Customs Department to ensure the medication is legal in Malaysia. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Air Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons.  It is typically at its worst in the dry season from July to October due to large agricultural fires in the region.  People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens People over 65 years of age People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema; People with heart disease or diabetes People who work or are active outdoors The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals .  We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Medical Facilities and Services: Adequate health facilities are available throughout the country but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Private hospitals usually require advance payment before admitting a patient. Medical staff in rural areas may speak little English. Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care typically only available through government institutions. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations.  Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on Medical Tourism. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Malaysia. We strongly recommend supplemental MEDEVAC insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Malaysia. Although Malaysia has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely.  If you plan to undergo surgery in Malaysia, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified. Pharmaceuticals Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas.  Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls.  Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients.  Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States.  Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States.  Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States.  Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy If you are considering traveling to Malaysia to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our ART and Surrogacy Abroad page . Although surrogacy agencies/clinics claim surrogacy is legal in Malaysia, there is no legal framework for foreigners or same-sex couples to pursue surrogacy in Malaysia.  As a result, surrogacy agreements between foreign or same-sex intending parents and gestational mothers are not enforced by Malaysia courts. If you decide to pursue parenthood in Malaysia via assisted reproductive technology (ART) with a gestational mother, be prepared for long and unexpected delays in documenting your child’s citizenship.  Be aware that individuals who attempt to circumvent local law risk criminal prosecution. Water Quality In many areas, tap water is not potable.  Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested.  Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Adventure Travel Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel . General Health Language The following diseases are prevalent: Malaria Dengue Chikungunya Leptospirosis Zika Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.  Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.

Penalties for using, possessing, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Malaysia are more severe than those in the United States, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines, or death. It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings such as military facilities, government buildings and offices, and Ministry of Health facilities including public hospitals and clinics. Driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail. Certain white-collar crimes are punishable by caning. If you purchase or collect local plants or wildlife without authorization from the Malaysian government, you may be prosecuted and sentenced to heavy fines, expulsion and/or imprisonment. It is illegal to distribute religious literature of another faith to Malaysian Muslims.  Special religious authorities and local police occasionally conduct raids on popular nightspots and hotels to deter activities among local Muslims that contravene religious customs, including drinking alcohol and adultery. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask the police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.  See our webpage for further information. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws.  You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States.  See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Currency: Currency exchange and Western Union money transfers are readily available.  Credit cards are accepted throughout the country, but you should be aware of the risk of fraud.  If possible, ensure your credit card remains in your presence during every transaction.  ATMs can be a safer means of obtaining Malaysian Ringgit.  PINs in Malaysia are six digits long, and some travelers have reported having difficulty retrieving cash from ATMs using four-digit PINs. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: Malaysia’s penal code criminalizes homosexual acts, termed “carnal intercourse against the order of nature,” leading to punishment of up to 20 years in prison and/or whipping, and police periodically raid LGBTQI+ frequented nightclubs and events.  Foreign same-sex marriages or civil unions are not recognized as legally valid.  Several states in Malaysia have instated Islamic Sharia laws, applying to male and female Muslims, criminalizing same-sex activity with up to three years imprisonment and whipping.  Transgender individuals have been arrested and charged with ""indecent behavior,” and received fines and prison sentences of up to three months.  Transgender individuals may also be denied entry to Malaysia at the discretion of the Malaysian immigration authorities.  LGBTQI+ individuals may face discrimination or even violence, especially in more conservative rural areas. See LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights Report for further details. Travelers With Disabilities: The law in Malaysia prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is not regularly enforced.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States.  The most common types of accessibility may include accessible government facilities, information, and communication/access to services.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, older lodging, and older public infrastructure, and common in newer lodging, communication/information, and newer public infrastructure.  Accessibility is more limited in rural areas. Malaysia has an active civil society and NGO community focused on disability welfare and protection. They are usually able to provide information and assistance in employment services, assistive devices and equipment, chore services, companion-based services, day services, and support network for parents. See our Travelers with Disabilities page. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: In cases of sexual assault, victims should go directly to the nearest major public hospital which will offer “one-stop” response including medical care and testing, forensic testing, access to the police to make a criminal report, legal assistance, counseling, and temporary shelter.  See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Maldives,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Maldives has a low crime rate and crime on resort islands is rare. Valuables may be stolen when left unattended on beaches or in hotels. The penalty for drug use or possession is severe. Demonstrations may take place in response to political or economic issues, but primarily take place in Malé or other larger cities and are unlikely to be noticed by tourists. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and FBI pages for information. Technology Usage Abroad: Mobiles devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated, and use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety consideration. Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Colombo for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 119 and contact the U.S. Embassy in Colombo at +94-11-202-8500. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur at all tourist facilities. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .","For Ambulance services in the Maldives, dial 102. Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Malé/Hulhumalé. Available ambulances are not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Some inter-island sea ambulance service is available via the Maldivian Navy but does not serve the entire country. We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health webpage and general Traveler Advice for Maldives.

The Department of State strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Medical Facilities: There are three large hospitals in the Malé area: ADK Hospital, Tree Top Hospital, and the government-run IGMH. Medical facilities outside Malé are limited. Hospitals and doctors typically require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. The availability of medical supplies is uneven and many common medications used in the United States are not available in Maldives; therefore, travelers should always carry any prescription medications with them. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Recommended vaccines that are specific to this region include Japanese encephalitis and typhoid (and rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis only if exposure to bats is anticipated). Pharmaceuticals : Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.

When transiting Maldives, travelers should ensure their luggage does not contain prohibited or restricted items, which include weapons, ammunition, alcohol, pornography, and religious material offensive to Islam, among other items. In some places, it is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings. Religious Laws : Public observance of any religion other than Islam is prohibited. Religious gatherings such as Bible study groups are prohibited; however, a family unit may practice its religion, including Bible readings, within its residence. It is against the law to invite or encourage Maldivian citizens to attend these gatherings. Offenders may face jail sentences, expulsion, and/or fines. Although Maldivian law prohibits importing “idols for religious worship,” tourists traveling to the resort islands are generally allowed to bring in items and texts used for personal religious observances. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . LGBTQI+ Travelers: The law prohibits same-sex sexual conduct. Under the penal code, the punishment for conviction includes up to eight years’ imprisonment and 100 lashes. None of the legal provisions prohibiting discrimination covers discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and the law does not recognize LGBTQI+ individuals, couples, and their families. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: While in Maldives, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what you find in the United States. The Maldivian constitution provides for the rights and freedom from discrimination of persons with disabilities, and parliament passed a Disability Act in 2010. The new law requires public places such as supermarkets and parks to have facilities that will enable access for people with disabilities. Despite the law, most public places do not yet have access for the disabled, and implementation of the law may take some time. Travelers: If you find yourself in a life-threatening situation, you should call the police immediately and follow up with a call to the U.S. Embassy in Colombo (+94-11-202-8500). We can sometimes connect you with a non-governmental organization in the Maldives that may be able to provide assistance. If you are victimized overseas, you may be entitled to receive compensation for counseling and/or other services such as relocation back to the United States.

Mali,"Read the Department of State’s Travel Advisory for Mali and Worldwide Caution before planning travel to Mali. Lawlessness and Instability: Mali faces significant security challenges. A disparate group of militias, bandits, politically motivated armed groups, and extremists exert influence in wide swathes of northern and central Mali. Malian state presence—including law enforcement, schools, and other public services—generally does not exist in those areas outside of major cities. The northern parts of the country continue to be plagued by insecurity due to terrorism and ongoing military operations, while  central Mali--in the Segou and Mopti Regions--is unstable due to violent intercommunal conflict, instigated by terrorist groups, and armed attacks. Terrorism: Travelers should avoid travel outside of Bamako because of insecurity and ongoing military operations. Terrorist groups with varying degrees of allegiance to al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) operate in Mali and often pursue local agendas complementary to these global jihadist movements. Groups linked with al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which have merged under the banner of Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), remain active and routinely conduct attacks targeting international and Malian military forces. These groups have claimed responsibility for small arms and improvised explosive attacks, kidnappings, and other violent actions, including attacks on the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). French troops, in collaboration with Malian security forces, conduct counterterrorism operations that target extremist elements. However, these foreign forces’ presence is not sufficient to counter every threat. Attacks by violent Islamist extremist groups have spread beyond the traditional conflict zone in the north to the center and south of the country. The area along the border with Burkina Faso and some remote parts of southern Mali are increasingly under threat of attack. In Bamako, hotels, restaurants, and other areas where Westerners congregate may be targeted by extremists. On June 18, 2017 terrorists attacked Hotel Kangaba, a popular destination for westerners and expatriates on the outskirts of Bamako, killing five civilians and one Malian first responder. Kidnapping: The threat of kidnapping of Westerners by criminal or terrorist groups remains high throughout the region. Extortion and kidnapping for ransom are significant sources of financing for JNIM-affiliated groups. In one exchange in 2020, JNIM released four hostages, including a Malian politician and three Westerners, for the release of some 200 prisoners held by Malian authorities. JNIM had executed another Western hostage shortly before the exchange. Travel Restrictions for U.S. Government Employees: U.S. government employees must seek permission before traveling outside of Bamako. They are also prohibited from using public transportation outside of Bamako. Although these restrictions do not apply to private U.S. citizens, you should take them into account when traveling in Mali. Civil Unrest: Periodic street demonstrations occur throughout Mali. Although some are planned and peaceful, demonstrations can occur spontaneously and turn violent. The majority of these are contained by security forces, but U.S. citizens should avoid street demonstrations and maintain security awareness at all times. Mali also has been subject to periodic coups, the most recent of which occurred in August 2020. Crime: Criminal traffickers of all kinds operate throughout the Sahel and may respond violently if encountered. Violent crimes are frequent; U.S. citizens should maintain a vigilant posture in all urban areas. There has been a recent uptick in police harassment and violent crime such as armed robbery, armed carjacking, and assault in Bamako. There are sporadic reports of nighttime robberies occurring on the roads outside of the capital; tourists should not drive at night (See Travel & Transportation section). For Your Safety: Guard your passport and wallet when in crowded outdoor areas and open-air markets. You may wish to consider carrying only paper copies of your passport and documents in these areas. Be vigilant for pickpockets, especially at night. Use all available safety measures in your home or hotel, including locking doors and windows at all times, as well as employing an alarm system. If asked to stop by police, stop only in well-lit areas or places where several officers are posted. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the U.S. Embassy. Report crimes to the local police at 80 00-11 25 (connection and response is not always reliable) and contact the U.S. Embassy during normal consular hours at (+223) 20 70 23 00, or after-hours at (+223) 66 75 28 60. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. However, response from local authorities and recourse for victims of crime is extremely limited. When you do interact with local police, always request a copy of the police report. Due to the vigilantism which often occurs when criminals are apprehended in Mali, it is best to avoid the large crowds that may gather at the scene of a crime, a vehicle accident, or any altercation. Please see our information for victims of crime, including help for U.S. victims of crime overseas , and possible victim compensation programs in the United States. The U.S. Embassy can: help you find appropriate medical care assist you in reporting a crime to the police contact relatives or friends with your written consent explain the local criminal justice process in general terms provide a list of local attorneys provide information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States_ provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution help you find accommodation and arrange flights home replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Medical facilities are extremely limited, especially outside of Bamako. U.S.-standard care does not exist. Most U.S. medicines are unavailable; European medications are more easily found and can be obtained at pharmacies throughout Bamako. Do not purchase the potentially dangerous counterfeit or expired medications sold on the local market. Carry with you an adequate supply of needed medication and prescription drugs, along with copies of the prescriptions, including the generic names for the drugs. If traveling with prescription medication, always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. The following diseases are prevalent: Malaria Yellow Fever Rabies Meningococcal meningitis Diarrheal diseases Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for travel in Mali. Malaria prophylaxis: Travelers should take prescription medicine before, during, and after your trip to prevent malaria. Your doctor can help you decide which medicine is right for you, and also talk to you about other steps you can take to prevent malaria. See the CDC website for more detailed information about malaria in Mali. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, expelled, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Travelers may be detained for questioning if stopped by the police and unable to produce their passport or for taking pictures of certain buildings. Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol may lead to arrest. If you break local laws, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. The U.S. government cannot get you out of jail. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Cultural Property: Mali is a signatory to the Treaty on Cultural Property, which restricts exportation of Malian archeological objects, in particular those from the Niger River Valley. Visitors seeking to export any such property are required by Malian law to obtain an export authorization from the National Museum in Bamako. Contact the Embassy of Mali in Washington D.C. or the nearest Malian consulate for specific information regarding customs requirements. U.S. Customs and Border Protection may impose corresponding import restrictions in accordance with the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act. Currency/Access to Funds: Currency exchange facilities are slow and often use out-of-date exchange rates. There are several ATMs in Bamako that accept U.S. credit/debit cards, though they do not always function reliably. There are some ATMs outside of Bamako in Segou, Sikasso, Koutiala, Gao, and Mopti, though they are occasionally inoperable. Credit cards are accepted at the larger hotels, Banque Atlantique, a few travel agencies (for an extra fee), some grocery stores, and upscale restaurants. Cash advances from credit cards are available in Mali via Western Union. The U.S. Embassy is unable to provide currency exchange services for private U.S. citizens. Photography: Exercise caution when taking photographs in Mali. Photographing any official object, entity, or person is restricted. These restrictions include infrastructure, facilities, government buildings, and individuals. You should obtain explicit permission from the Malian government before photographing transportation facilities and government buildings. Taking a photograph without permission in any public area or around any of the above listed facilities often provokes a prompt response from security personnel or offends the people being photographed. Taking photos of the U.S. Embassy in Bamako is also prohibited. Communication: Communication infrastructure in Mali is of limited coverage, especially outside of major cities, but there is cellular phone coverage in Bamako. International telephone calls are expensive. Internet service providers offer service in many areas of Bamako, and fiberoptic service is available for a price. Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTI events in Mali. Societal discrimination, however, is widespread. LGBTI individuals have experienced physical, psychological, and sexual violence, which society views as corrective punishment and police frequently refuse to intervene. Most LGBTI individuals isolate themselves and keep their sexual identity hidden. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: There is no law protecting the rights of persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or in the provision of other state services, nor requiring accommodation and access to public facilities. No special accommodations or officially reduced fares or rates are available to persons with disabilities in public transportation or taxis, communications, lodging, medical facilities, restaurants, cafés, bars or other tourist spots. Foot paths and pedestrian-friendly road crossings are rare and generally inaccessible to persons with disabilities. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: Domestic violence, including spousal abuse, is common. Although the law prohibits spousal abuse, it does not prohibit domestic violence. The minimum age to marry without parental consent is 16 for females and 18 for males. Girls may marry with parental consent at age 15 if a civil judge approves. However, child marriage remains a common practice. Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is legal in Mali and widely practiced. The Government of Mali prohibits FGM/C in government-funded health care centers. See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Malta,"Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Malta’s open borders with members of the Schengen zone allow the possibility of individual terrorists entering/exiting the country undetected. CRIME: The most commonly reported crimes are simple assault , pick-pocketing , and petty theft . While armed robberies, sexual assaults, and homicides are not as common as in some major U.S. cities, they do occur. Criminals focus on areas and establishments frequented by tourists. Secure your valuables, and be aware of pick-pockets and purse snatchers. Theft of unattended property is a very common problem. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Nightclubs: You should be careful in the Paceville nightclub area, where excessive drinking, large crowds, and interaction with heavy-handed bouncers can lead to violence , including some that appears to be racially-motivated . Criminals have drugged some travelers at bars and robbed and assaulted them. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+356) 2561-4000.

Malta’s crime victim assistance agency, Appogg , can be reached by calling its support line (dial 179) or by visiting its website . The local equivalent to the 911 emergency line in Malta is 112 . Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not occur on a regular basis.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","Medical care is available from private and government clinics and hospitals. The quality of medical care in Malta is at U.S. standards; however, customer service standards are lower, there are cultural differences with regard to communication, and there may be long waiting times for non-urgent medical care . Medical specialists are few. Private hospitals generally offer better customer service, shorter wait times, and more amenities. Mater Dei is Malta’s main government hospital. Though it offers full service, including a modern emergency room and trauma facilities, it can be crowded and difficult to navigate. The U.S. Government does not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas . Most overseas care providers only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution . Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Malta are severe . Malta’s laws on the rights of arrestees are different from the United States. For example, once you have contacted a lawyer, you lose your right to remain silent. Judicial Proceedings for Criminal Offenses in Malta: Trials typically last five to seven years and are characterized by lengthy and sometimes unpredictable delays between hearings. Foreign nationals can expect to be denied bail while a court case is ongoing, which can result in lengthy periods of pre-trial detention ranging from several months to several years. Obtaining no-fee legal aid can be a slow and difficult process, delaying already lengthy judicial proceedings. Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Customs and Currency Restrictions: Malta customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning currency restrictions and temporary importation into or export from Malta of items such as firearms , antiquities , or any item that might be deemed to have resale value. It is advisable to contact the Maltese Embassy in Washington, D.C. for specific information regarding customs requirements. Malta’s customs authorities encourage the use of an ATA (Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission) Carnet for the temporary admission of professional equipment, commercial samples and/or goods for exhibitions and fair purposes. The U.S. Council for International Business issues and guarantees the ATA Carnet in the United States.

Mauritania,"Read the Department of State’s Travel Advisory for Mauritania and Worldwide Caution before planning travel to Mauritania. Terrorism: The U.S. government assesses that a credible terrorist threat against foreigners remains in Mauritania. U.S. citizens in Mauritania should take precautions, remain vigilant, and be alert to local security developments. Travel in Mauritania is discouraged, particularly in the easternmost region, due to activities by terrorist groups including al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which are active in the neighboring regions of Mali. Traveling safely within Mauritania: You should exercise prudence and caution when traveling in Mauritania. Be particularly vigilant when traveling by road outside of populated areas. The U.S. Embassy discourages travel outside of urban areas unless in a convoy accompanied by an experienced guide, and even then only if equipped with sturdy vehicles and ample provisions. Nighttime driving should be avoided. Travel at night between cities in Mauritania is prohibited for U.S. Embassy staff and all driving outside of the capital of Nouakchott requires a minimum two vehicle convoy. Landmines remain a danger along the border with the Western Sahara and travelers should cross only at designated border posts. Political concerns: Protests and political rallies occur frequently in Mauritania, and can sometimes turn violent. The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to avoid political rallies and street demonstrations. Crime: Criminal activity in Nouakchott continues to rise. A number of homes and private individuals, including U.S. citizens, have recently been targeted by violent criminals. In Nouakchott, armed robberies and burglaries are occurring at homes as well as on busy streets in broad daylight. Some of these incidents have been violent, and the use of knives and other weapons is becoming more common. Because of the increase in criminal activity, U.S. Embassy staff and their family members are prohibited from walking alone outside of designated areas and times. U.S. citizens have been victims of assaults, including sexual assaults. Given the lack of government regulation of taxi fares and poor regular maintenance, U.S. citizens should avoid taxis and public transportation.

Mexico,"Travelers are urged to review the Mexico Travel Advisory for information about safety and security concerns affecting the country on a state-by-state basis. U.S. citizens traveling to and residing in Mexico should not expect public health and safety standards like those in the United States. Even where such standards exist, enforcement varies by location. Travelers should mitigate the risk of illness or injury by taking standard health and safety precautions. The phone number to report emergencies in Mexico is “911.” Although there may be English-speaking operators available, it is best to seek the assistance of a Spanish speaker to place the call. Crime: Crime in Mexico occurs at a high rate and can be violent, from random street crime to cartel-related attacks. Over the past year, Mission Mexico has assisted U.S. citizens who were victims of armed robbery, carjacking, extortion, homicide, kidnapping, pick-pocketing, and sexual assault. Increased levels of cartel-related violence have resulted in territorial disputes and targeted killings, injuring or killing innocent bystanders. Travelers who find themselves in an active shooter scenario should flee in the opposite direction, if possible, or drop to the ground, preferably behind a hard barrier. Drivers on roads and highways may encounter government checkpoints, which often include National Guard or military personnel. State and local police also set up checkpoints in and around cities and along the highways to deter criminal activity and enforce traffic laws. In some parts of Mexico, criminal organizations and other non-governmental actors have been known to erect unauthorized checkpoints and have abducted or threatened violence against those who fail to stop and/or pay a “toll.” When approaching a checkpoint, regardless of whether it is official, cooperate and avoid any actions that may appear suspicious or aggressive. While Mexican authorities endeavor to safeguard the country’s major resort areas and tourist destinations, those areas have not been immune to the types of violence and crime experienced elsewhere in Mexico. In some areas of Mexico, response time of local police is often slow. In addition, filing police reports can be time consuming. See our Mexico Travel Advisory for more information. Demonstrations occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Protesters in Mexico may block traffic on roads, including major thoroughfares, or take control of toll booths on highways.  Travelers who encounter protesters who demand unofficial tolls are generally allowed to pass upon payment.  U.S. citizens should avoid participating in demonstrations or other activities that might be deemed political by authorities, as Mexican law prohibits political activities by foreign citizens and such actions may result in detention or deportation. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Mexico. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Inheritance notices Bank overpayments Mexico’s consumer protection agency, PROFECO (Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor, Spanish only), can sometimes provide assistance (Spanish only) to victims of such scams. In addition, there have been allegations of banking fraud perpetrated by private bankers against U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens who believe they have been victims of fraud can file a police report file a complaint (Spanish only) with the Mexican banking regulatory agency, CONDUSEF (Comision Nacional para la Proteccion y Defensa de los Usuarios de Servicios Financieros, Spanish only), or consult with an attorney. Victims of Crime: U.S. victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest Consulate for assistance.  Report emergencies to the local police at 911, report crimes already committed to the Ministerio Publico, and contact the Embassy or Consulate at +52-55-85262561.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. U.S. citizen victims of crime should contact the local authorities to file a Mexican police report before departing Mexico. In most instances, victims of crime will file reports with the Ministerio Publico (equivalent to the office of public prosecutor or district attorney in the United States) and not with police first responders. U.S. citizens should also inform the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulat e . See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: help you find appropriate medical care, assist you in reporting a crime to the police, contact relatives or friends with your written consent, provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion, provide a list of local attorneys, provide information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States , provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution, help you find accommodation and arrange flights home, replace a stolen or lost passport. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate for assistance. Kidnapping: Mexico experiences very high rates of kidnapping.  If you believe you or your U.S. citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) relative has been kidnapped, please contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate immediately. Robbery: Mexico experiences robberies, typically in cities, in which abductors force victims to use their debit or credit card to withdraw money from ATMs in exchange for their release. Perpetrators commonly work in cooperation with, or pose as, taxi drivers. To minimize the risk of such robberies: Only use a reputable taxi company or a trusted ride-sharing app. Book taxis through your hotel or an authorized taxi stand. Extortion: Extortion schemes are common in Mexico.  In a typical scheme known as a virtual kidnapping, criminals convince family members that a relative has been abducted, when, in fact, the person is safe but unreachable.  The purported abductors will often use threats to persuade victims to isolate themselves, making communication with family members less likely.  Unable to reach their loved ones, family members often consent to paying the “ransom” demand.  Criminals use various means to gather information about potential victims, including monitoring social media sites, eavesdropping on conversations, or using information taken from a stolen cell phone.  Some of these extortions have been conducted from Mexican prisons.  You can reduce the risk of falling victim to this type of extortion through the following: Do not discuss travel plans, your room number, or any other personal information within earshot of strangers. Do not divulge personal business details to strangers in person or over the phone, especially when using hotel phones. If you are threatened on the phone, hang up immediately. Sexual Assault: Rape and sexual assault are serious problems in some resort areas. Many of these incidents occur at night or during the early morning hours, in hotel rooms, on hotel grounds, or on deserted beaches. In some cases, assailants drug the drinks of victims before assaulting them. Pay attention to your surroundings and to who might have handled your drink. Credit/Debit Card “Skimming:” There have been instances of fraudulent charges or withdrawals from accounts due to “skimmed” cards. If you choose to use credit or debit cards, you should regularly check your account to ensure there are no unauthorized transactions. Travelers should limit the amount of cash they carry in public, exercise caution when withdrawing cash from ATMs, and avoid ATMs located in isolated or unlit areas. Alcohol: If you choose to drink alcohol, it is important to do so in moderation and to stop and seek medical attention if you begin to feel ill. There have been reports of individuals falling ill or blacking out after consuming unregulated alcohol. The Mexican Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risk, COFEPRIS ( Comision Federal para la Proteccion contra Riesgos Sanitarios, Spanish only ), is responsible for inspecting hotels, restaurants, and other establishments for health violations, including reports of unregulated alcohol. Please email COFEPRIS at contactociudadano@cofepris.gob.mx for more information or if you wish to file a report. You can file a report online (Spanish only) via the COFEPRIS website, by calling the COFEPRIS call center at 800 033 50 50 (from Mexico) or +52 (55) 5080-5425 (from the United States), or by scheduling an appointment (Spanish only) to visit a COFEPRIS office. There have also been instances of criminals drugging drinks to rob or sexually assault victims. Additionally, if you feel you have been the victim of unregulated alcohol or another serious health violation, you should notify the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate . You may also contact the U.S. Department of State – Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington, D.C. at 1-888-407-4747 (toll-free in the United States and Canada) or 1-202-501-4444 (from all other countries). Drug Smuggling: Mexican criminal organizations are engaged in a violent struggle to control trafficking routes. Criminal organizations smuggling drugs into the United States have targeted unsuspecting individuals who regularly cross the border. Frequent border crossers are advised to vary their routes and travel times and to closely monitor their vehicles to avoid being targeted. Tourism: In major cities and resort areas, the tourism industry is generally well-regulated.  Best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced.  Hazardous areas and activities are identified with appropriate signage, and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and/or provide life-saving assistance.  In smaller towns and areas less commonly frequented by foreign tourists, the tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in or near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance . Since 2016, Mexico has opened seven multilingual Centers for the Care and Protection of Tourists (CAPTA) and Tourist Assistance Centers (CATTAC) in Los Cabos, La Paz, Acapulco, Playa del Carmen, Mazatlan, Ciudad Madero, and Queretaro. These offices have proven helpful assisting U.S. citizen visitors in resolving disputes with merchants and government entities, filing criminal reports, securing needed services, and locating special needs accommodations.","Excellent health facilities are available in Mexico City and other major cities. Ambulance services are widely available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi to a health provider. Mexican facilities often require payment “up front” before providing medical care, and most hospitals in Mexico do not accept U.S. health insurance. A list of doctors and hospitals is available on the U.S. Embassy or consulate website. U.S. citizens have lodged complaints against some private hospitals in Cancun, the Riviera Maya, and Los Cabos to include exorbitant prices and inflexible collection measures.  Travelers should obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care in these locations.  Be aware that some resorts have exclusive agreements with medical providers and ambulance services, which may limit your choices in seeking emergency medical attention.  Some hospitals in tourist centers utilize sliding scales, deciding on rates for services based on negotiation and on the patient’s perceived ability to pay.  In some instances, providers have been known to determine the limits of a patient’s credit card or insurance, quickly reach that amount in services rendered, and subsequently discharge the patient or transfer them to a public hospital. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for information on Medical Tourism. For emergency services in Mexico, dial 911 .  Although there may be English-speaking operators available, it is best to seek the assistance of a Spanish speaker to place the call. Ambulance services are: widely available in major cities but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards, not present in many remote and rural areas of the country, not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. We do not pay medical bills: Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation as well. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check the Mexican government’s Drug Schedule to ensure the medication is legal in Mexico. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further health information : World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) Air Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals .  We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery: U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery. Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations.  Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on Medical Tourism. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Mexico.  Several foreigners have successfully enlisted the support of PROFECO (Spanish only) in order to resolve disputes over medical services. Although Mexico has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely.  If you plan to undergo surgery in Mexico, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified. Pharmaceuticals Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas.  Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls.  Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients.  Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. The Drug Enforcement Agency reports counterfeit prescription pills are sold by criminals on both sides of the border. These pills are sometimes represented as OxyContin, Percocet, Xanax, and others, and may contain deadly doses of fentanyl. Counterfeit pills are readily advertised on social media and can be purchased at small, non-chain pharmacies in Mexico along the border and in tourist areas.  U.S. citizens have become seriously ill or died in Mexico after using synthetic drugs or adulterated prescription pills. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States.  Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States.  Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States.  Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Visit the Mexican Health Department website (Spanish only) or contact the Embassy of Mexico in Washington, D.C., for more information about obtaining a permit to import medicine into Mexico. For a list of controlled substances in Mexico, visit the COFEPRIS website (Spanish only) and the Mexican Drug Schedule (Spanish only). U.S. citizens should carry a copy of their prescription or doctor’s letter, but it is still possible that they may be subject to arrest for arriving in Mexico with substances on these lists. Note that a medicine considered “over the counter” in some U.S. states may be a controlled substance in Mexico. For example, pseudoephedrine, the active ingredient in Sudafed, is considered a controlled substance in Mexico. For more information, contact the Embassy of Mexico in Washington, D.C. Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy If you are considering traveling to Mexico to have a child using assisted reproductive technology (ART) including surrogacy, visit the State Department’s ART and Surrogacy Abroad page for general information regarding U.S. citizenship for the child. Surrogacy in Mexico presents serious risks that must be considered before U.S. citizens begin the surrogacy process. If you decide to pursue parenthood in Mexico via ART with a gestational mother, be prepared for possible long delays to document your child’s birth in Mexico and their U.S. citizenship by obtaining a U.S. passport. Ensure you understand Mexican law, which varies by state. The only four states with a legal framework for surrogacy do not permit foreigners and/or same-sex couples to use the procedure. In the other 28 states, surrogacy is largely unregulated. In most states, Mexican courts may not enforce surrogacy agreements between non-Mexican or same-sex intending parents and a gestational mother should disputes arise, due to a lack of legal framework for surrogacy. The U.S. Embassy is aware of several cases where surrogacy agencies presented a partial, or false, interpretation of Mexican surrogacy laws. In most Mexican states, the gestational mother is the child’s legal parent with full parental rights, and the gestational mother’s name is typically listed on the Mexican state-issued birth certificate. In certain states, a court may amend the birth certificate to remove the name of the gestational mother. The U.S. Embassy is aware of cases of foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens, being arrested for attempting to circumvent local law related to surrogacy. Carbon Monoxide Many hotels and other lodgings are not equipped with carbon monoxide detectors, even if they contain sources of this potentially lethal gas. U.S. citizens have died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning throughout Mexico. If your lodging is not equipped with a carbon monoxide detector, consider traveling with a portable one. Water Quality: In many areas in Mexico, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks might be made using tap water. Altitude: Many cities in Mexico, such as Mexico City, are at high altitude, which can lead to altitude illness. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Travel to High Altitudes . Adventure Travel Participation in adventure sports and activities may not be covered by accident insurance and safety protections and regulations for these activities may differ from U.S. standards.  Visit our website and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about adventure travel. General Health The following diseases are prevalent: COVID-19 Hepatitis Typhoid Fever Travelers’ Diarrhea Dengue Chikungunya Zika Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Parasitic Infections Chronic Respiratory Disease Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in Mexico. Air Quality Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Mexico. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. For further health information, go to: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Private Residential Treatment Facilities: These facilities provide care to U.S. citizens throughout Mexico and include child behavior modification facilities, rehabilitation facilities, and assisted living centers. There is a wide range in standards for education, safety, health, sanitation, immigration, and residency.  Staff licensing may not be strictly enforced or meet the standards of similar facilities in the United States. The State Department has received reports of abuse, negligence, or mismanagement at some of these facilities. U.S. citizens should exercise due diligence and do extensive research before selecting a residential treatment facility.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate immediately. See our webpage for further information. The Mexican government is required by international law to contact the U.S. Embassy or consulate promptly when a U.S. citizen is arrested if the arrestee so requests.  This requirement does not apply to dual nationals. Firearms and Other Weapons: Weapons laws in Mexico vary by state, but it is generally illegal for travelers to carry weapons of any kind including firearms, knives, daggers, brass knuckles, as well as ammunition (even used shells). Illegal firearms trafficking from the United States to Mexico is a major concern, and the Department of State warns all U.S. citizens against taking any firearm or ammunition into Mexico. If you are caught entering Mexico with any type of weapon, including firearms or ammunitions, you likely will face severe penalties, including prison time. U.S.-issued permits allowing an individual to carry weapons are not valid in Mexico.  Visit the Department’s Traveling Abroad with Firearms webpage . Vessels entering Mexican waters with firearms or ammunition on board must have a permit previously issued by a Mexican embassy or consulate. Drugs: Drug possession and use, including medical marijuana, is illegal in Mexico and may result in a lengthy jail sentence or fines. Electronic Cigarettes (Vaping Devices): It is illegal for travelers to bring electronic cigarettes (vaping devices) and all vaping solutions to Mexico. Customs will confiscate vaping devices and solutions and travelers could be fined or arrested. Avoid delays and possible sanctions by not taking these items to Mexico. Real Estate and Time Shares: U.S. citizens should exercise caution when considering time-share investments or purchasing real estate and be aware of the aggressive tactics used by some sales representatives. Before initiating a real estate purchase or time-share investment, U.S. citizens should consult with a Mexican attorney to learn about important regulations and laws that govern real estate property. Mountain Climbing and Hiking: The Mexican government has declared the area around the Popocatepetl and the Colima volcanoes off limits. In remote rural areas, there can be limited cell phone coverage and internet connectivity, and it may be difficult for rescue teams and local authorities to reach climbers and hikers in distress. Potential for Natural Disasters: Mexico is in an active earthquake zone. Tsunamis may occur following significant earthquakes. Please visit our disaster and crisis preparedness webpage for more information. For additional information concerning disasters, see: U.S. Embassy Mexico City website Civil Protection ( Proteccion Civil, Spanish only ) provides information from the Mexican Government about natural disaster preparedness U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides general information about natural disaster preparedness U.S. Geological Survey provides updates on recent seismic and volcanic activity Storm Season: Tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico or along the Caribbean and Pacific Coast between May and November can produce heavy winds and rain. Please visit our disaster and crisis preparedness webpage for more information. Spring Break: Millions of U.S. citizens visit Mexican beach resorts each year, especially during “ spring break ” season. The legal drinking age in Mexico is 18. See the “Alcohol” section above to learn more about the risks associated with drinking, as well as reports of illnesses associated with the possible consumption of unregulated alcohol. Resort Areas and Water Activities: Beaches in Mexico may be dangerous due to strong currents, rip tides, and rogue waves. Warning notices and flags on beaches should be taken seriously. Not all hazardous beaches are clearly marked. If black or red warning flags are up, do not enter the water. Strong currents can lead to dangerous conditions for even the most experienced swimmers. U.S. citizens simply walking along the shore or wading have been swept out to sea by rogue waves, and some citizens have drowned or disappeared at Mexican beaches. Avoid the consumption of alcohol while engaging in water activities and do not swim alone. Boats used for excursions may not be covered by accident insurance and sometimes lack adequate life jackets, radios, and tools to make repairs.  Participation in adventure sports may not be covered by accident insurance and safety protections and regulations for these activities may differ from U.S. standards.  Visit our website and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about adventure travel. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also be subject to fines or forced to relinquish the goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information.

However, due to sporadic reports of violence targeting LGBTQI+ individuals, U.S. citizens should exercise discretion in identifying themselves publicly as LGBTQI+. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and Section 6 of the Department of State’s Human Rights Report for Mexico for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: Mexican law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.  The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication/access to services/ease of movement or access.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure in more rural and remote parts of the country, and more common in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure in major cities.  U.S. citizens with disabilities should consult individual hotels and service providers in advance of travel to ensure they are accessible.

Micronesia,"Crime: Petty theft, physical and sexual assaults, and other violent crimes occur in the FSM. Outside of city limits, local residents may wield guns as a form of intimidation. Crime rates are significantly higher in Chuuk and incidents in Chuuk have included assaults on U.S. citizens. Crime increases at night and alcohol usually plays a role, especially in assaults.

Health care facilities in the FSM consist of state-run hospitals on each of the four major islands and a few scattered clinics. There is a lack of medical infrastructure for treating trauma cases, especially those involving extreme sports. Medical evacuation assistance is available only by air. Due to the remoteness of the islands, assistance can take days to arrive and is expensive. There are no daily commercial flights on Chuuk, Yap or Kosrae. Because flights often sell out, finding last-minute seats is difficult. For emergency services in the FSM, dial 911. Ambulance services are not widely available. Training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. In Pohnpei, Chuuk, Yap and Kosrae States, you can reach ambulance services by calling the State hospitals.

Moldova,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Police have the legal right to ask for identification on the street. Carry your passport or a photocopy of it at all times. If a police officer stops you, ask to see his or her identity card (“legiti-MAT-seeya” in Romanian, which is the official language in Moldova.). Moldovan police have the word “POLITIA” printed on the backs of their uniforms. Traffic police should also display a metal badge on the outside of their uniforms. If a police officer harasses you or asks for a bribe, try to record the officer’s name, title, badge number, and physical description. Contact the U.S. Embassy to report the incident at the earliest opportunity. Transnistria Region Transnistria is a breakaway region that is not under the control of the Moldovan government in Chisinau. Visitors are required to present identification to cross the administrative boundary of the Transnistria region; those without a Moldovan government-issued identification document may be requested to present a passport. Visitors may also be required to present identification and/or a passport at additional checkpoints manned by uniformed peacekeepers along roads leading into and out of the region. Ukraine has closed its border crossing points into the Transnistrian region. Taking photographs of military facilities and security forces is prohibited and may result in trouble with authorities. The U.S. government’s ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens traveling in Transnistria maybe be limited or delayed since Transnistria’s de facto authorities control access to the region.

Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Air Quality : Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals here. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Health facilities in general: Adequate health facilities are available in Chisinau and other major cities but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies. Hospitals and doctors sometimes require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. In small cities and villages, medical staff may speak little or no English. Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight. Pharmacies are not always stocked to Western standards, and products may not be labeled in English. Poor quality and/or counterfeit medications have been reported. Tuberculosis is an increasingly serious health concern in Moldova.","Criminal Penalties : You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the U.S. Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. If you are arrested, you can face extended periods, even years, in pre-trial detention. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs are severe, and if convicted, you can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. You should register large sums of foreign currency (equivalent of 10,000 Euros and above) and declare all valuable goods with Moldovan customs authorities when you arrive in Moldova. Failure to do so can result in confiscation, fines, and/or arrest. For more information about customs requirements, see the Moldovan Customs webpage . Counterfeit and Pirated Goods : Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTQI+ events in Moldova. However, traditional cultural attitudes towards LGBTQI+ individuals may result in discrimination and harassment. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities : The law in Moldova prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in lodging and general infrastructure and common in public transportation and information. The general infrastructure for disabled people is not developed in the villages and in the small cities as it is in the capital. Some accessibility equipment and devices can be bought and repaired in Moldova. It’s difficult to find a sign language interpreter service in Moldova. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Special Circumstances: Credit cards are accepted in Chisinau, and occasionally in the rest of the country, but rarely in small villages. Use your credit card with caution and protect your personal information. Individuals considering doing business in Transnistria, a breakaway region that is not under the control of the Moldovan government in Chisinau, should exercise extreme caution. Many Transnistrian firms are not legally registered with Moldovan authorities, which may complicate or prevent the import or export of goods. The government of Moldova will not recognize the validity of contracts for the privatization of firms in Transnistria without the approval of the appropriate Moldovan authorities. Western credit cards and cell phones do not work in Transnistria; Moldovan leii are not accepted as a form of payment in Transnistria. The U.S. government’s ability to provide services to U.S. citizens traveling in Transnistria may be limited or delayed since Transnistria’s de facto authorities control access to the region."
Monaco,"Political violence in Paris and throughout France is relatively uncommon, although there are occasional instances of extremely large demonstrations simultaneously occurring in many French cities. Large demonstrations in Paris are generally managed by a strong police presence, but even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly escalate into violence. We recommend that U.S. citizens avoid demonstrations if possible, and exercise caution if within the vicinity of any demonstrations. The congestion caused by large demonstrations can cause serious inconveniences for a visitor on a tight schedule. Some sporting events, such as soccer matches, have occasionally degenerated into violence that continued into the streets. Political unrest has developed in some Francophone countries with historic ties to France (e.g., Algeria, Mali, Cote d’Ivoire, and Tunisia). Some French citizens and residents with ties to such countries have protested in front of those countries’ embassies or consulates in France in response to the unrest. Although these protests are infrequent and do not target U.S. citizens, visitors should avoid such demonstrations. The Government of France maintains a threat rating system, known locally as “Vigipirate,” similar to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Advisory System. Under this plan, the government routinely augments police with armed forces and increases visibility at airports, train and metro stations, and other high-profile locations such as schools, major tourist attractions, and government installations. Over the last few years, there have been arrests of suspected militant extremists allegedly involved in terrorist plots. French authorities have periodically spoken publicly about the heightened threat conditions for terrorist attacks in Europe. The United States and France routinely share information in order to disrupt terrorist plotting, identify and take action against potential operatives, and strengthen defenses against potential threats. Although U.S. citizens have not been specifically targeted in terrorist attacks in France within the past few years, travelers should remain vigilant. Immediately report unattended packages observed in public places or any other suspicious activities to French law enforcement authorities, who are proactive and will respond immediately. If there is a security incident or suspicious package, do not linger in the area to observe. Public safety and security in France are maintained by three different forces: Municipal Police; National Police; and the military Gendarmerie. These services are professional, competent, and proactive in fighting crime and violence and maintaining overall state security. In an emergency, dialing 17 will connect the caller to the Police in both France and Monaco. You can also dial the Europe-wide emergency response number 112 to reach an operator for all kinds of emergency services (similar to the U.S. 911 system) in France. Non-French speakers may experience a delay while an English speaker is located. For non-emergency assistance, visitors should go to the nearest police station (commissariat) in order to file an official report. Special Issues for LGBT Travelers: France and Monaco are generally safe destinations for LGBT individuals; however, local media and human rights organizations have noted an increase in the number of reported anti-LGBT hate crimes across France after the French Parliament began debating a law to legalize same-sex marriage in late 2012.

Here are some useful tips for traveling safely abroad . CRIME: Prior to travel to France, the United States State Department recommends that all visitors check the Department’s website for updated security advisories . General: France is a relatively safe country. Most crimes are non-violent, but pick-pocketing is a significant problem. The same is true for Monaco. See the section below entitled “Tips on How to Avoid Becoming a Victim.” The majority of crimes directed against foreign visitors, including U.S. citizens, involve pick-pocketing, residential break-ins, bicycle theft, and other forms of theft with minimal violence. However, as in any big city, robberies involving physical assault do occur in Paris and other major urban areas. Visitors to congested areas and known tourist sites (e.g., museums, monuments, train stations, airports, and subways) should be particularly attentive to their surroundings. Crimes against visitors are generally crimes of opportunity, though these crimes are more likely to involve violence on the street late at night or when the victim detects the theft and resists the criminal. As in any major city, women should exercise extra caution when out alone at night and/or consider traveling out at night with companions. In general, Paris taxis are safe and professionally operated, but there has been an increase in reported harassment and assaults on women by taxi drivers. Caution is required throughout France when driving through economically depressed areas where there is a high incidence of “smash and grab” robberies. Thieves will approach a vehicle that is stopped in traffic, smash a window, reach into the vehicle to grab a purse or other valuable item, and then flee. Keep doors locked and valuables out of sight. There is generally an increase in the number of residential break-ins in August, when most French residents take vacation, and in December. The majority are attributed to residents not using security measures already in place, including double-locking doors and locking windows. Home invasions are often preceded by phone calls to see if the resident is at home. Often thieves who manage to gain access to the apartment building will knock on apartment doors to see if anyone answers, offering the excuse they are taking a survey or representing a utility company. PARIS: Crime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively uncommon in the city center, but women should exercise extra caution when out alone at night, and should consider traveling out at night with trusted companions. There has been an increase in reported sexual harassment, and sometimes assault, by taxi drivers. Pickpockets are by far the most significant problem. In addition to purses and wallets, smart phones and small electronic devices are particular targets. In Paris, pickpockets are commonly children under the age of 16 because they are difficult to prosecute. Pickpockets are very active on the rail link (RER B) from Charles de Gaulle Airport to the city center. Travelers may want to consider using a shuttle service or one of the express buses to central Paris rather than the RER. In addition, passengers on metro Line 1, which traverses the city center from east to west and services many major tourist sites, are often targeted. A common method is for one thief to distract the tourist with questions or disturbances, while an accomplice picks pockets, a backpack, or a purse. Schemes in Paris include asking if you would sign a petition or take a survey, and presenting a ring and asking if you dropped it. Thieves often time their pickpocket attempts to coincide with the closing of the automatic doors on the metro, leaving the victim secured on the departing train. Many thefts also occur at the major department stores (e.g., Galeries Lafayette, Printemps, and Le Bon Marché), where tourists may leave wallets, passports, and credit cards on cashier counters during transactions. Popular tourist sites are also popular with thieves, who favor congested areas to mask their activities. The crowded elevators at the Eiffel Tower, escalators at museums such as the Louvre, and the area surrounding Sacré Coeur Basilica in Montmartre are all favored by pickpockets and snatch-and-grab thieves. There have been some instances of tourists being robbed and assaulted near less utilized metro stations. The area around the Moulin Rouge, known as Pigalle, requires extra security precautions to avoid becoming a victim. Pigalle is an adult entertainment area known for prostitution, sex shows, and illegal drugs. Unsuspecting tourists have run up exorbitant bar bills and been forced to pay before being permitted to leave. Other areas in Paris where extra security precautions are warranted after dark are Les Halles and the Bois de Boulogne. PROVENCE ALPES MARITIMES (PACA) / LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON (Marseille, Montpellier, Perpignan, Carcassonne Avignon, Aix en Provence, Arles, Cannes, Nice): The PACA/Languedoc-Roussillon region enjoys a fairly low rate of violent crime directed at tourists. The most common problems in the region are thefts from cars (both stopped in traffic and parked) and from luggage trolleys at the major transportation hubs, including the nice airport and railway stations in Marseille, Avignon, and Aix en Provence. Purse snatchings in transportation hubs are also a common problem. The U.S. Consulate General in Marseille has noted an increase in holiday rental-home burglaries and in necklace snatching. Keep your car doors locked and windows rolled up at all times. Valuables should be hidden out of site to prevent snatch-and-grab attempts. Maintain visual contact with your car when visiting tourist sites, when using rest facilities at gas stations, or stopping to enjoy panoramic views, even for a short period as thieves will break windows to access items left in cars. Victims have reported break-ins within minutes of leaving an unattended car. Keep your passport in a separate location from other valuables. Organized crime has increased in the south of France—especially in Marseille and Corsica, where feuding groups have been responsible for several recent violent incidents—and although U.S. citizens are not targeted, you should maintain awareness and keep emergency contact information on hand should you find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time. STRASBOURG: Strasbourg's historic center enjoys a fairly low rate of violent crime. Pickpockets and snatch-and-grab thieves tend to concentrate their efforts in the Petite France historic district popular with visitors. BORDEAUX AND THE AQUITAINE, LIMOUSIN, AND POITOU-CHARENTES REGIONS: Bordeaux and other cities in southwest France are considered fairly safe. In cities and during popular festivals that draw huge crowds, you should be wary of pickpockets and other tourist-aimed crimes, especially near public transportation. Stolen purses, ID cards, and passports left in cars – particularly around renowned landmarks are common. Note: Swimmers should be careful of strong riptides and swells in the Bordeaux area. LYON: Although levels of violent crime are low, Lyon has a fair amount of petty crime and vandalism. Late-night weekend rowdiness is common in the center of town and in areas with night clubs. The city’s public transportation system is safe. To combat reckless and drunk drivers and prevent them from fleeing accident scenes, Lyon initiated 30 kilometer-per-hour zones in commercial districts, and the local police have increased controls for drunken driving. Police have also installed speed and red-light radar systems. The number of stolen passports and personal items in the district remains relatively low, and attacks are rare. Home break-ins have increased recently; according to the local news, there are 30-35 per day. Police response to sporadic armed robberies and violence is generally immediate and decisive. A recent wave of armed robberies in luxury goods stores and cash exchange businesses ended with the arrest of an organized gang of delinquents. Bicycle thefts are also a serious risk, as Lyon becomes increasingly bicycle-friendly and more people cycle around town. NORMANDY: Break-ins and thefts from cars in the parking lots at the Normandy beaches and American cemeteries are common. Do not leave valuables unattended in a car. Locking valuables in the trunk is not an adequate safeguard as thieves often pry open car trunks to steal bags and other valuables. OVERSEAS (NON-EUROPEAN) FRENCH DEPARTMENTS AND TERRITORIES: Please see the Country Specific Information for French Guiana , French Polynesia , and the French West Indies for crime trends in these areas. RENNES: In general, the city of Rennes is relatively safe and secure, and crime rates throughout the consular district tend to be lower than in larger cities elsewhere. There are occasional crimes in the center of Rennes related to drunkenness and rowdy behavior, with the largest and most boisterous crowds tending to gather on Thursday nights in the area around Rue Saint Michel (a.k.a. “Rue de la Soif” or “Thirst Street”) and the adjacent Place Sainte Anne. The local authorities make security a priority. Tourists occasionally encounter theft of valuables and passports. Valuables left unattended in rental cars overnight, or for extended amounts of time, are particularly susceptible to theft. In particular, tourist sites around Brittany warn travelers against leaving expensive items in plain view in parked cars due to frequent vehicle break-ins. Do not leave luggage unattended on trains. TOULOUSE AND THE MIDI-PYRENEES: Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees region are considered generally safe. Car theft, vehicle break-ins, petty theft, and burglary are the most common crimes, and they are relatively more frequent in areas near the railway station. Car-jacking and home invasions may occur, particularly in wealthier areas surrounding Toulouse. Home invasions usually target valuables and cars, but may include violence. Itinerant street people, often in groups accompanied by dogs, are increasingly prevalent in downtown Toulouse, particularly in warmer weather. While alcohol and drug abuse can make them unpredictable, incidents of crime are relatively rare. Tips on how to avoid becoming a victim: Common-sense security precautions will help you enjoy a trouble-free stay. Most problems can be avoided by being aware of one's surroundings and avoiding high-risk areas. When going out, carry only essential items: ONE credit/ATM card, ONE piece of identification, and no more than €40-50. Avoid carrying high-value jewelry and large amounts of cash. Valuables should be kept out of sight and in places difficult for thieves to reach, such as internal coat pockets or in pouches hung around the neck or inside clothes. Shoulder bags and wallets in back pockets are an invitation to a thief. Keep photocopies of travel documents and credit cards separate from the originals, along with key telephone numbers to contact banks for credit card replacement. Raise your awareness level while in crowded elevators, escalators, and metro cars. When possible, take a seat or stand against a wall to deter pickpockets and try to maintain a 360-degree awareness of the surrounding area. Carry only a purse that zips closed and ensure that it is carried under the arm and slightly in front of the body. Swing backpack-type purses around so that they are slightly in front of your body. Carry your wallet in a front pocket. While on foot, remain aware of your surroundings at all times and keep bags slung across your body and away from the street. Many U.S. citizens have had purses or bags stolen from the back of a chair or from under the table while in cafes, restaurants, and nightclubs/bars, including higher end establishments. Again, keep your valuables with you and never leave them unattended or out of your sight. Do not leave valuables in hotel rooms. If you must leave valuables in the hotel, consider using the hotel safe. Thieves often operate in groups and often come to each other's aid if confronted. If a thief is caught in the act, a simple pick-pocketing could turn into an assault (or worse) if you attempt to capture the thief. You can shout out for police assistance to attract attention, but do not pursue the thief. Do not use ATMs in isolated, poorly lighted areas or where loiterers are present. Be especially alert to persons standing close enough to see the Personal Identification Number (PIN) being entered into the machine. Thieves often conduct successful scams by simply watching the PIN as it is entered and then stealing the card from the user in some other location. If your card gets stuck in an ATM, immediately report the incident to both the local bank and your bank at home. Many theft and assault victims are targeted when making their way home from a late night out after drinking alcohol. If you go out late at night, do so with a group of friends. There is safety in numbers. Use only authorized taxis. Authorized taxis in Paris have the following equipment: An illuminated “Taxi Parisien” sign on the roof; A display meter showing the cost of the trip; A display at the rear of the vehicle and visible from the exterior that enables the monitoring of the daily duration of use of the vehicle; and A plate fixed to the front fender bearing the license number. There has been an increase in sexual harassment and assault of women by taxi drivers in recent years. Women may want to consider having another individual walk them to a taxi and, in plain view of the driver, note the license number of the vehicle, or call a friend while in the taxi and communicate the license number. Letting the driver know that others are aware of your trip and the license number of the taxi may reduce the chances of becoming a victim. Avoid public parks after dark, as they are often frequented by drug dealers and prostitutes. The Paris Police Prefecture publishes a pamphlet entitled “ Paris in Complete Safety ” that provides practical advice and useful telephone numbers for visitors. VICTIMS OF CRIME: If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime abroad, you should contact the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. We can: Replace a lost or stolen passport ; Provide information on the most rapid means for money transfer; Assist with contacting family members or friends; Help you find appropriate medical care following violent crimes such as assault or rape; and Put you in contact with the appropriate Although the local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime, consular officers can help you understand the local criminal justice process and can direct you to local attorneys . If you have been the victim of a pick-pocket and would like to report your items lost or stolen please see our Guide for Reporting Lost or Stolen Items . For more serious crimes, compensation is available under French law to victims of crime committed on French soil under certain circumstances. Read our information on victims of crime for more information, including possible victim-compensation programs in the United States. The European equivalent to the U.S. 911 emergency line is 112. Non-French speakers may experience a delay while an English speaker is located. Alternatively, one can call French emergency numbers specific to the type of incident: 17 (police emergency); 18 (fire department/paramedics); and 15 (medical emergency/paramedic team/ambulance). We also maintain information on our website on where to get help in instances of child abuse . For private legal matters, commercial disputes, tourist, trade, or property complaints, refer to the Department of State’s information on retaining a foreign attorney . Consular staff is prohibited from providing legal representation or guidance, but we can refer you to French law directories, bar associations, or other organizations for assistance. You can also refer to our list of attorneys in France. CRIMINAL PENALTIES: While in France, you are subject to its laws even if you are a U.S. citizen. Individuals who hold U.S. and French or Monegasque citizenship should be aware that local authorities may treat you as solely French or Monegasque. Criminal penalties vary from country to country, and there are some things that might be legal in France or Monaco, but still illegal in the United States. You can be prosecuted under U.S. law if you buy counterfeit or pirated goods in another country. Engaging in sexual conduct with minors or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is also a crime prosecutable in the United States . If you commit a crime in another country, your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution. It’s very important to know what’s legal and what’s not where you are going. If you use any of France’s excellent public transportation services, take particular care to retain your used or “validated” ticket. Inspectors conduct intermittent, random checks, and passengers who fail to present the correct validated ticket for their journey are subject to stiff and immediate fines. Inspectors may show no interest in explanations and no sympathy for an honest mistake. Failure to cooperate with inspectors can result in arrest. If arrested: While some countries will automatically notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate if a U.S. citizen is detained or arrested in a foreign country, that might not always be the case. To ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances, request that the police and prison officials notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate as soon as you are arrested or detained.","Medical care is comparable to that found in the United States. In an emergency, dial 15 to connect to emergency medical services. You can also dial the Europe-wide emergency response number 112 to reach an operator for all kinds of emergency services (similar to the U.S. 911 system). Non-French speakers may experience a delay while an English speaker is located. For non-emergency medical assistance in France, you may refer to this list of medical professionals . You can find good information on vaccinations and other health precautions on the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC) website . For information about outbreaks of infectious diseases abroad, consult the World Health Organization (WHO) website , which also contains additional health information for travelers, including detailed country-specific health information .","There are strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from France of items such as firearms, antiquities, medications, business equipment, sales samples, and other items. You should contact the Embassy of France or one of France's consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements. Please see our Customs Information . Note on the French Foreign Legion: U.S. citizens interested in joining the French Foreign Legion should be aware that the cognitive and physical tests to join are extremely challenging. Legionnaire candidates should ensure that they have access to sufficient funds to return home should their candidature be refused. Accessibility: In France, accessibility and accommodation for individuals with disabilities are very different from what you find in the United States. French law requires that any new building with public or community space and any existing public building be accessible for persons with disabilities. However, many existing buildings, as well as transportation systems, do not yet meet these requirements. Getting around in French cities may be difficult at times. Many sidewalks are narrow and uneven, and cobblestone streets make access difficult, but the major tourist areas have better facilities. Although the Paris Metro is a very efficient method for traveling throughout central Paris, most stations are not readily accessible for people with disabilities. Very few stations have elevators and most have stairways and long corridors for changing trains or exiting to the street. However, many Parisian buses and tramways are equipped with lowering platforms for travelers with limited-mobility, or who are sight- or hearing-disabled. Taxis are also a good mode of transportation. An English-language Paris Visitors Bureau website and a French-language, government-sponsored website contain additional information and include links to a downloadable local transportation map specifically designed for travelers with special mobility needs. There are many other resources available on the internet for disabled persons traveling to, or living in, France. For further information, e-mail any of our consular offices ."
Mongolia,"Travelers are urged to review the Mongolia Travel Advisory , which provides information about safety and security concerns affecting the country. The phone number to report crimes to the local police in Mongolia is 102 . The number to call an ambulance or fire truck in an emergency is 103 . Please note that local authorities, including the operators responding to these emergency numbers, do not commonly speak English. Crime: Mongolia is a relatively safe country for foreigners. However, both street crime and violent crime are on the rise, especially in the larger towns and cities. Crime typically peaks during the Naadam summer festival in July and during the Tsagaan Sar (Lunar New Year) festival in January or February. Most street crime occurs late at night, often outside bars and nightclubs. Theft: Pickpocketing and bag-snatching can occur at any time, especially in crowded places like markets, train stations, and popular tourist attractions. You should take precautions to protect your personal effects when in public. The Embassy has also received reports of visitors’ accommodations being burgled while occupied. These burglaries most often occurred when travelers were staying in yurt (known in Mongolia as ger) camps where locking the door to the accommodation may be impossible. Robbery: The most common form of robbery experienced by visitors to Mongolia is mugging. You are most likely to be mugged if you are alone in unfamiliar urban neighborhoods after dark, or in unregistered private vehicles operating as taxis. Stick to well-lit and well-established tourist areas and use registered taxis whenever possible. Sexual assault: Though infrequent, the Embassy does receive reports of sexual assaults perpetrated against travelers. These reports indicate that perpetrators are most often familiar with the victim in some way such as tour guides or employees of locations frequented by tourists, like ger camps and monasteries. If you are a victim of sexual assault contact the Mongolian police immediately and seek assistance from the Embassy by calling +976 7007-6001. Female travelers are encouraged to avoid traveling alone in Mongolia and all travelers should research and hire only reputable tour agencies with established safety and security records, especially when visiting remote areas far from the capital. The police will instruct victims of sexual assault to obtain an examination at the criminal forensic institute, which is in Ulaanbaatar city or in provincial centers. A medical check from any other clinic/hospital will not be admitted into evidence at any judicial proceeding. The Embassy can assist in helping you locate these centers. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Street harassment: Street harassment is especially prevalent at night and in areas outside the capital. The most common targets of street harassment are unaccompanied women and foreign men accompanying Mongolian or other Asian women. Street harassment may range from verbal abuse to physical assault. Certain nationalist groups also perpetrate premeditated attacks against foreigners. Most street harassment occurs in or near bars and nightclubs, and alcohol is often involved. All travelers should avoid walking alone after dark, avoid using unregistered taxi cabs, and moderate their use of alcohol in order to avoid becoming an easy target for harassment in public. Drug offenses: Mongolian police are particularly keen on combatting the use of drugs, a problem they generally see as imported by foreigners. Penalties for drug possession and or trafficking in Mongolia range from one to twelve years imprisonment. Smuggling of contraband goods, antiquities, and wildlife: Smuggling of these items is prevalent across both the Russian and Chinese borders. Travelers have been known to be duped into transporting contraband goods or controlled antiquities from Mongolia. Be wary of other passengers requesting help with their luggage, as it could contain illicit articles. Penalties for smuggling in Mongolia vary based on the items smuggled and range from one month of electronic monitoring to eight years imprisonment and fines from 450,000 MNT to 40,000,000 MNT equivalent to 160 USD to 14,000 USD as of September 2020. Demonstrations: Demonstrations are common in many parts of Mongolia but are most prominent in the capital Ulaanbaatar. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can become confrontational and escalate into violence. Protesters may block traffic on roads, including major thoroughfares. U.S. citizens should avoid demonstration areas and exercise caution if near any protests. Some demonstrations by Mongolian ultra-nationalists take a xenophobic turn and may place foreigners at heightened risk should they encounter these events. U.S. citizens should avoid participating in demonstrations and other activities that might be deemed political by Mongolian authorities. Alcohol: If you choose to drink alcohol, it is important to do so in moderation and to stop and seek medical attention if you begin to feel ill. Alcohol is an important aspect of Mongolian social culture and strangers may offer to drink with travelers as a welcoming gesture. While most of these offers are innocuous and truly a friendly gesture, travelers should be wary of accepting beverages offered on the street by strangers who approach them late at night as these are often the precursor to a robbery. The prevalent use of alcohol is also connected to a high frequency of physical altercations sometimes resulting in injury. U.S. citizen travelers are known to have become wittingly or unwittingly involved in such altercations and injured. Driving under the influence: Mongolian police take driving under the influence very seriously and enforcement is vigorous in urban areas. Penalties for driving under the influence in Mongolia include a one-year suspension of driving privileges and a 400,000 MNT fine, roughly 140 USD as of September 2020. Travelers should exercise the same precautions as they would in the United States, use of a designated driver or a taxi, to avoid operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Victims of Crime: Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. If you are the victim of a crime you should contact the local authorities to file a Mongolian police report. You should also inform the U.S. Embassy. A crime may only be reported in person at the local police district having jurisdiction over the location where the crime occurred. Before reporting a crime, you may wish to consult an attorney. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of English-speaking lawyers that you may access online. You must have your passport or residency permit with you. Once you report a crime to the police Mongolian law requires that you remain in the country for the duration of both the investigation and any subsequent trial. In some instances, the law provides for a victim to appoint a legal representative to take their place. The police will instruct victims of assault or sexual assault to undergo an examination by the criminal forensic institute which is located in Ulaanbaatar or in provincial centers. No other medical examination will be accepted as evidence by Mongolian authorities. The Embassy can assist in helping you locate these centers. It is important to note that, if a victim does not file a complaint, police may refuse to investigate the crime--even if they have probable cause to suspect that a crime took place. Please see our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . If you are the victim of a crime the U.S. Embassy can: help you find appropriate medical care and provide a list of doctors and hospitals assist you in reporting a crime to the police contact relatives or friends with your written consent explain the local criminal justice process in general terms provide a list of local attorneys provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S. as well as local resources provide an emergency loan for repatriation, which includes accommodation and flights back to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution replace a stolen, lost, or damaged passport Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated. Mongolia’s vast area and limited road and communications infrastructure make emergency response challenging for local and national authorities. Mongolia’s severe weather—desert conditions in the summer in many tourist areas and dangerously cold in the winter (-40° F) across the country—exacerbates the potential for urgent situations, especially in the event of injury or becoming lost or disoriented outside of city centers. The Embassy recommends travelers not drive outside of Ulaanbaatar or other city centers after sunset.  In winter visitors should always keep high-quality cold-weather clothing in vehicles, even for short trips, to protect oneself in the event of delay or becoming stranded.  Routine safety inspections for emergency and medical equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and tour guides and tourist attraction staff may not be adequately trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, basic medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities, with significant limitations on the availability of medication and quality of health care.  First responders are generally unable to quickly access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","With few exceptions, Mongolian hospitals do not meet Western standards. Although most doctors and emergency responders are dedicated professionals, their training and equipment are sub-standard. Most modern medical facilities are in Ulaanbaatar, though some public and private hospitals in larger provincial cities offer medical services on par with those in the capital. Medical services may be completely unavailable in remote areas. Mongolia does not have helicopter medical evacuation and those who require medical assistance in remote areas must drive to the nearest major town. Medical evacuation to Ulaanbaatar is conducted by commercial air carriers. Some pharmacies in Ulaanbaatar carry European or U.S. pharmaceuticals, but quantity and variety is limited. Most pharmaceuticals are made in China or Russia, and lack English labels. See our list of medical facilities in Ulaanbaatar . Air Pollution: Due to the pervasiveness of coal-burning for domestic heating, Ulaanbaatar and most other Mongolian cities suffer severe air pollution during winter. The U.S. Embassy’s air quality monitor registers Air Quality Indices (AQIs) in excess of 300 most days from December through February. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency describes AQIs above 300 as “hazardous.” Air pollution can cause both short- and long-term health effects and poses an especially high risk to children, pregnant women, the elderly, outdoor enthusiasts, and people with heart or lung disease. Travelers planning to visit Ulaanbaatar during winter should consult a medical professional and should, at the very least, consider carrying an N95 mask to help filter out harmful particulates. For reliable and timely air pollution readings, check the U.S. Embassy’s live air quality monitor . Water Quality: The quality of drinking water varies throughout Mongolia and it is likely not up to U.S. standards for potability. Most Mongolians do not drink tap water and instead prefer to consume bottled water for their domestic use. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. The U.S. Embassy does not provide medical evacuation, but will contact the insurance company on your behalf to arrange medical evacuation if necessary. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the Mongolian Embassy to ensure the medication is legal in Mongolia. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. The following diseases are prevalent: Rabies Plague Meningococcal meningitis Tuberculosis Measles Influenza Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, then you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are prosecutable in the United States, even if violated abroad. For examples, see the Department of Justice website and our website on crimes against minors abroad . Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Customs: Mongolian customs authorities strictly enforce laws regulating the import and export of firearms, ammunition, precious metals, antiquities and drugs. Importation of firearms or ammunition requires prior government approval. All precious metals should be declared on arrival. Exporting antiquities requires a special customs clearance certificate issued by an authorized antique dealer at the time of purchase. Importing medicines is not allowed. Medicines for personal use must have doctor’s prescription. Vitamins are limited only for personal use. Quantity of more than 2 packages will result in taxation. For additional information, contact the Embassy of Mongolia . Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: Mongolia’s criminal code prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, language, race, age, gender, social status, professional position, religion, education, or medical status. There are no laws or legal provisions that criminalize being LGBTI or that specifically target the LGBTI community. However, NGOs continue to report that LGBTI individuals face violence and discrimination both in public and at home based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. There were also reports that LGBTI persons face greater discrimination and fear in rural areas than in Ulaanbaatar. The Government of Mongolia does not recognize same-sex spouses for visa and residency purposes. See our LGBTI Travel Information and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Major streets in Ulaanbaatar feature textured sidewalks to aid visually impaired pedestrians, but numerous obstacles prevent persons with disabilities from moving freely. Government buildings and public transportation remain largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. Mongolian elevators are often too small to accommodate a standard-sized wheelchair. Service animals are rare and are often barred from entering public buildings. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: Domestic violence and sexual assault are serious problems in Mongolia. See the Safety & Security section above, as well as our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Montenegro,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, rudimentary Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Montenegrin nightclubs are popular with foreign tourists. Patrons should be aware that these establishments can be crowded and may not comply with Western standards for occupancy control or fire safety. Crime: Police have limited English ability. Violent crime is rare. Robberies at ATMs increases during the May to September tourist season. Visitors should protect their PINs when using ATMs and monitor their card activity.

Montserrat,"Crime: U.S. citizens are not specifically targeted for crime in the Eastern Caribbean islands. However, crimes of opportunity such as petty larceny, burglary, automobile break-ins; as well as incidents of violent crime, such as murder, sexual assault, robbery, shootings, and drug related crimes do occasionally occur. As you would in any major metropolitan area of the United States, use the below personal security measures while traveling: Do not leave valuables unattended in public areas, on beaches, unsecured in hotel rooms, or in rental homes. Avoid walking alone, especially at night, on beaches, and in isolated or poorly lit areas. Go out in groups or with a companion and restrict nighttime activities to established safe and reputable venues. Use only clearly marked taxis and avoid rides with strangers. Stick to well-lit and well-traveled routes. Avoid displaying flashy jewelry, expensive electronics, and large amounts of cash. Be aware of your surroundings at all times. If you see something suspicious or unusual contact local police to report immediately. Use added caution when shopping in crowded areas, especially during the holiday season. Use added caution when attending crowded events, celebrations, music festivals, etc. Do not leave drinks unattended in public venues as this could create a potential vulnerability for the use of “date rape” drugs in furtherance of criminal activity. Do not be predictable; vary your daily routes and schedules. Do not engage in illegal activity. For boaters: Be wary of unfamiliar persons or crafts approaching your boat, whether at anchor or at sea. *Abide by the above security measures at all times, be aware of your surroundings in all areas, and use added vigilance while in isolated areas that tourists do not normally frequent. Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods. These are illegal in the United States, and you may also be breaking local law. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (246) 227-4000. For medical and fire emergencies call 999.

Avoid entering the water above your waist if you have been drinking and always be mindful of jet ski and boat traffic in the area. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.

Morocco,"All countries in the region remain vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations or individuals inspired by extremist ideology with little or no warning. The potential for terrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens exists in Morocco. Long an important counterterrorism partner with the United States, Morocco’s capable security services have taken robust actions to guard against terrorist attacks. Moroccan authorities continue to disrupt groups seeking to attack U.S. or Western-affiliated and Moroccan government targets, arresting numerous individuals associated with international terrorist groups. Nevertheless, credible information indicates terrorist groups continue to plot potential attacks in the region, including Morocco. Lone wolf attacks are difficult to detect and disrupt and can occur without warning. In December 2018, two Scandinavian tourists were murdered by three Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) supporters in the Imlil Mountains near Marrakesh. U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant with regards to their personal security. Establishments that are identifiable with the United States are potential targets for attacks. These may include facilities where U.S. citizens and other foreigners congregate, including clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools, hotels, movie theaters, U.S. brand establishments, and other public areas.  U.S. citizen campers should camp in guarded campgrounds rather than isolated campsites. Demonstrations: Demonstrations occur frequently in Morocco, are typically focused on political or social issues, and are only rarely confrontational or violent. During periods of heightened regional tension, large demonstrations may take place in major cities. By law, all demonstrations require a government permit, but spontaneous unauthorized demonstrations, which have greater potential for violence, can occur. In addition, different unions or groups may organize strikes to protest an emerging issue or government policy. Travelers should be aware of current events in Morocco and stay informed of regional issues that could resonate in Morocco and create an anti-American response. Avoid demonstrations if at all possible. If caught in a demonstration, remain calm and move away immediately when provided the opportunity. Exercise increased vigilance in areas that attract large crowds, such as sporting events. Western Sahara: From 1975 to 1991, Western Sahara was the site of armed conflict between Moroccan government forces and the POLISARIO Front, which continues to seek independence for the territory. Tensions along the border in Western Sahara heightened in November 2020 when Moroccan forces conducted an operation on the border to clear a blockade by the POLISARIO Front; both sides have since engaged in a low intensity conflict along the border. There are thousands of unexploded mines in the Western Sahara and in areas of Mauritania adjacent to the Western Saharan border. Exploding mines are occasionally reported and have caused death and injury. There have been instances in which U.S. citizens suspected of being participants in political protests or of supporting NGOs that are critical of Moroccan policies have been expelled from, or not been allowed to enter, Western Sahara. Crime: Crime in Morocco is a serious concern, particularly in major cities and tourist areas. Use common sense and the same personal security measures you would normally use in a large U.S. city or tourist destination. Do not leave bags unattended. Keep them in sight and avoid placing passports, cash, cell phones, or other valuables in the outer pockets of backpacks or purses, or on tables in public places. Do not leave bags slung over the backs of chairs, on hotel or store counters, on top of your suitcase or larger travel bag, or out of your physical control in hotel lobbies, train stations, restaurants, and other public locations. Aggressive panhandling, pick-pocketing, purse-snatching, theft from unoccupied vehicles, and harassment of women are the most frequently reported issues. Criminals use weapons, primarily knives, during some street robberies and burglaries. These crimes have occurred at any time of day or night, not only in isolated places or areas less frequented by visitors, but in crowded areas as well. Residential break-ins also occur and have on occasion turned violent, but most criminals look for opportunities based on stealth rather than confrontation. Travelers should avoid soccer stadiums and their environs on days of scheduled matches as large groups of team supporters have been known to become unruly and harass and assault bystanders. Joggers should be mindful of traffic and remain in more heavily populated areas. It is always best to have a jogging companion, dress modestly, and avoid isolated areas or jogging at night. At night and when moving about unfamiliar areas, avoid traveling alone and utilize “petit” taxis which vary by color in the major cities (Casablanca-Red, Rabat-Blue, Marrakech-Tan, etc.). Taxis* in Morocco are generally crime-free during day time, although city buses are not considered safe. Trains are generally safe, but theft, regardless of the time of day, sometimes occurs. Avoid carrying large sums of cash and be particularly alert when using ATM machines. In the event you are victimized by crime or an attempted crime, please report the incident to the local police and the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca as soon as possible. * NOTE: Some popular web-based ride-sharing services have operated in Morocco; however, the French-based company Heetch is currently the only service legally authorized to operate by the Moroccan Government. Media report that drivers of web-based ride-sharing services have been harassed and assaulted by regular taxi drivers in the recent past. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of crimes should contact the local police at 19 from a land line or 190 from a mobile phone, and the U.S. Consulate in Casablanca at (212) 522 64 20 99. Remember that the local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: help you find appropriate medical care; assist you in reporting a crime to the police; with written consent, contact your relatives or friends; explain the local criminal justice process in general terms; provide a list of local attorneys; provide information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States; provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution; help you find accommodation and arrange flights home; replace a stolen or lost passport. Tourism : The tourism industry is generally regulated in major tourist areas.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. However, outside of these areas, the tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.","Adequate medical care is available in Morocco’s largest cities, particularly in Rabat and Casablanca, although not all facilities meet Western standards. Emergency and specialized care outside the major cities is far below U.S. standards and may not be available at all. Most medical staff will have limited or no English-speaking ability. Most ordinary prescription and over-the-counter medicines are widely available. Specialized prescriptions may be difficult to fill and availability of all medicines in rural areas is unreliable. Travelers should not ask friends or relatives to send medications through the mail, FedEx, or UPS since Moroccan customs will impound the delivery and not release it to the recipient. Travelers planning to drive in the mountains and other remote areas may wish to carry a medical kit and a Moroccan phone card for emergencies. In the event of vehicle accidents involving injuries, immediate ambulance service is usually not available. The police emergency services telephone number is “190” (see Traffic Safety and Road Conditions section below). The U.S. Mission in Morocco is unable to pay your medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. You may also be required to pay a deposit before being admitted for treatment. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .

Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. In some places you may be taken in for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Consulate immediately. See our webpage for further information. Crimes of fraud, including passing bad checks, non-payment of bills (including hotel bills), or breach of contract are considered serious in Morocco and can often result in imprisonment and/or fines. Bail generally is not available to non-residents of Morocco who are arrested for crimes involving fraud. Debtors can be held in prison until their debts are paid or until an agreement is reached between the parties. Passports may be seized by the Moroccan government to guarantee that debtors settle their cases. Debtors may be unable to work in Morocco without passports while still being held responsible for their debts. Prior to entering into a contract, you may want to consider consulting an attorney. Faith-Based Travelers : Islam is the official religion in Morocco. However, the constitution provides for the freedom to practice one's religion. The Moroccan government does not interfere with public worship by the country’s Jewish minority or by expatriate Christians. Proselytizing is, however, prohibited. In the past, U.S. citizens have been arrested, detained, and/or expelled for discussing or trying to engage Moroccans in debate about Christianity. In February 2014, several U.S. citizens were expelled from Morocco for alleged proselytizing. Many of those expelled were long-time Moroccan residents. In these cases, U.S. citizens were given no more than 48 hours to gather their belongings or settle their affairs before being expelled. See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report . LGBTI Travelers: Consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Morocco. Penalties include fines and jail time. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: While in Morocco, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what is customary in the United States. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers : Women walking alone in certain areas of cities and rural areas are particularly vulnerable to assault by men. They should exercise caution when in public spaces, including nightclubs or other social establishments. Women are advised to travel with a companion or in a group when possible and to ignore any harassment. See our tips for Women Travelers . Customs: Travelers must declare large quantities of U.S. dollars brought into the country at the port of entry. The export of Moroccan currency (dirhams) is prohibited; however, Moroccan currency can be converted back into U.S. dollars prior to departure only if the traveler has a bank or money transfer receipt indicating he or she exchanged dollars for dirhams while in Morocco. Moroccan customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Morocco of items such as firearms, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drones, religious materials, antiquities, business equipment, and large quantities of currency. It is advisable to contact the Embassy of Morocco in Washington, D.C., or the Moroccan Consulate General in New York for specific information concerning customs requirements. Please see our information on Customs and Import Restrictions. Citizenship : The Government of Morocco considers all persons born to Moroccan fathers to be Moroccan citizens. In addition to being subject to all U.S. laws, U.S. citizens who also possess the nationality of Morocco may be subject to other laws that impose special obligations on citizens of Morocco. Recently, Morocco has begun allowing Moroccan mothers of children born outside Morocco to petition for their children’s citizenship. For further information on that process, please contact the Embassy of Morocco in Washington, D.C., or the Moroccan Consulate General in New York . Residency Permits: In order to obtain a residence permit, travelers must present (among other requirements) a criminal history record check. This record check can only be obtained in the United States. The U.S. Consulate and Embassy are unable to take fingerprints to send for FBI record requests. For specific information, individuals seeking residency should visit their local police station. The following documents must accompany a residency renewal application: Birth Certificate Copy of the current passport Copy of the current Moroccan residency card Medical certificate from a doctor stating that the requester is free from any contagious disease Court record (Casier Judiciaire) obtained from the Ministry of Justice in Rabat 100 MAD stamp Individuals planning on residing in Morocco or relocating to the U.S. may be asked to provide a notarized change of residence form. This form is available at the U.S. Consulate by appointment. Sending Passports through the Mail: According to Moroccan law, it is prohibited to send passports by mail across international borders. Passports sent to or through Morocco via Fedex, DHL, or other courier will be confiscated by Moroccan authorities. Confiscated U.S. passports are eventually sent to the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca after being processed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If your passport has been confiscated, you can contact the American Citizens Services section at acscasablanca@state.gov to ask if it has been received. Property: U.S. consular officers are prohibited by law and regulation from accepting personal property for safekeeping regardless of the circumstances involved. If there is concern over the protection of property left behind in Morocco due to confiscation or deportation for political, legal, or other reasons, U.S. citizens should take every precaution to ensure that available legal safeguards are in place either before, or immediately after, purchasing property in Morocco or taking up residence there. U.S. citizens are also encouraged to consider assigning a Power of Attorney, or Procuration, to be used in Morocco if necessary. More information and sample Power of Attorney forms are available on the Consulate General of the Kingdom of Morocco in New York website. Photographing Sensitive Locations: Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in problems with the authorities. As a general rule, travelers should not photograph palaces, diplomatic missions, government buildings, or other sensitive facilities and when in doubt should ask permission from the appropriate Moroccan authorities. Professional Basketball in Morocco: The U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca is aware that there are local professional basketball teams who have made contracts with U.S. citizens to play on Moroccan teams.

Mozambique,"Please read the full Travel Advisory for Mozambique. Road travel outside the city after dark is dangerous. U.S. government personnel are prohibited from traveling outside the major cities after dark by car, and are encouraged not to travel outside the city alone. You should be vigilant when you travel in Mozambique and if you travel to/from South Africa, as both countries have high crime rates. Crime: Street crimes, including mugging, purse-snatching, and pick-pocketing are common in Maputo and in secondary cities. Carjackings are rare, but still occur. Pedestrians have been mugged at all hours of the day. Avoid isolated areas and walking at night, even in well-known tourist areas. Avoid walking along the Marginal south of the Southern Sun Hotel and Avenida Friedrich Engels and Rua Caracol. Avoid walking along roads bordered by wooded areas, as criminals may hide there. Johannesburg International Airport: Secure your bags. Use an airport plastic wrapping service. Avoid placing currency and high value items in checked luggage when transiting. Landmines: Mozambique was declared free of all known landmines in 2015; however, there could remain unknown mines in very rural areas. Seek local information before going off-road outside major cities. Information about specific safety and security issues can be found on the U.S. Embassy Maputo’s website . Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy at +258 21-49-0723. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

Fraud: The U.S. Embassy in Maputo has received reports of scams which originate online, and involve promises of large inheritances that require international travel. Victims of this type of scam are asked to deliver suitcases from one location to another, and become unwitting narcotics traffickers. Be skeptical about financial promises made by an online contact, and never carry anything that you did not pack yourself. See the Department of State page for more information on scams. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  There is some tourism infrastructure, often operated by expatriates, but the host government has limited capacity to regulate.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified, either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the relevant field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical treatment, especially outside normal working hours.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","Consult the CDC website for the Mozambique prior to travel. Medical facilities are rudimentary, and most medical providers do not speak fluent English. Medications are not always available.  Public and private medical facilities exist in the city of Maputo and most provincial capitals. All health care providers require payment at the time of or before providing service. Most do not accept credit cards. You are responsible for all medical costs. U.S. Medicare does not cover you overseas. Prescriptions Medications: Check with Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure the medication is legal to bring into the country.  Always, carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

Further health information : World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to host country laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be deported, arrested or imprisoned.  It’s very important to know what’s legal and what’s not wherever you go. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Carry your passport with you at all times. You can be taken in for questioning if you cannot present your passport. Photography of some government buildings may be illegal. Ask before taking pictures. Driving under the influence can land you immediately in jail. Your U.S. passport will not help avoid arrest or prosecution. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Faith-Based Travelers: See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report . LGBTI Travelers: Mozambique is a very tolerant society. Consensual same-sex relations are not criminalized and there is increasing space in public conversation regarding LGBTI issues. There remains, however, some societal stigmatization and room for progress in terms of full equal treatment, such as in the registration of LGBTI groups. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Although the government legislatively mandates access to public buildings, transportation, and government services for persons with disabilities, few buildings are accessible. Restaurants, hotels, and residential buildings have stairs at the entrance without wheelchair ramps, except perhaps at a few major hotels and retail areas. Pedestrian paths and transportation are extremely difficult for persons with disabilities. Sidewalks are not commonplace and, if they exist, are poorly maintained and dangerous to walk on at night. Pedestrian crossings are infrequent and drivers seldom obey traffic signals. Buses and taxis do not have special accommodations for disabled persons. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: Rape: The law prohibits rape, including spousal rape, but it is not effectively enforced and is largely unknown in rural areas where the majority of rapes take place. Penalties range from two to eight years’ imprisonment if the victim is 12 years of age or older and 20 to 24 years’ imprisonment if the victim is under 12, according to the new penal code. Domestic Violence: The law prohibits violence against women. Domestic violence against women, particularly spousal rape and beatings, remain widespread. Abuse of a spouse or unmarried partner is punishable with one to two years in prison, or a greater penalty if in conjunction with another crime. See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Namibia,"Road Travel: Namibia has thousands of miles of unpaved roads. Road accidents, particularly on gravel roads, pose the most serious threat to visitors. Many gravel roads are well-maintained and can provide unaccustomed drivers a false sense of security, with road conditions shifting dramatically in certain areas. See recommendations below on road safety in Namibia. Crime: Non-violent crimes of opportunity are the most common incidents reported by foreigners and include pick pocketing, purse snatching, ATM card skimming, and vehicle thefts and break-ins. Criminals sometimes brandish knives and guns. Violent crimes, including murder and rape, and property crimes increased in Windhoek over the last year. Robberies occur at roadside rest stops. Dress conservatively. Avoid walking alone, especially after dark, and displaying cash and valuable personal property. Make sure your hotel room or residence is well secured, including windows. Keep your credit card in your sight at all times while it is being processed. Consider using prepaid credit cards with limited funds when traveling. Take rest breaks in towns and/or at gasoline stations. Transport crimes: Violent assaults on taxi passengers are known to occur; petty theft is prevalent and occurs on trains, buses, and in taxis. Be aware of criminals using remote key fobs to unlock vehicle doors in parking lots. Drive with doors locked and windows closed. Keep valuables out of sight and do not use cell phones or laptops while stopped in traffic; bandits may use smash and grab tactics to steal valuables. Hire taxis through a hotel or retain the services of a reputable private transport company. Checkpoints: The police maintain checkpoints approximately 9 miles (15 km) outside of main cities and all major highways. During the holiday season, additional checkpoints may be established along the Windhoek-Swakopmund highway (B1). Remain inside your vehicle with doors locked and open the window slightly to communicate. Be prepared to produce vehicle registration documents, personal identification (passport, Namibian identification cards), car rental contracts, and/or drivers’ licenses. Proceed only when waved through. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.

Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient. Medical staff may speak little English outside of Windhoek, especially in rural areas. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Namibia. Persons traveling to Namibia for medical purposes require the proper “medical” visa. Check the Government of Namibia’s website for more information. Pharmaceuticals U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Water Quality In many areas, tap water is not potable.

Currency: The Namibian dollar (NAD) is the official currency. It is pegged to the South African rand, which is also legal tender in Namibia. Carefully inspect ATMs for skimming technology before using. Credit cards are generally accepted. Wild Animal Parks : Heed all instructions given by guides or trackers. Use common sense and maintain a safe distance when approaching wildlife. Even in the most serene settings wild animals pose a lethal threat. Lions, leopards, elephants, oryxes, rhinos, hippos, and crocodiles have critically injured and killed individuals in the region.

Nepal,"All U.S. Citizen travelers are encouraged to enroll into Smart Traveler Enrollment Program while traveling abroad. This is a free service that allows U.S. citizens traveling or living abroad to receive the latest security updates from the U.S. Embassy. Enrolling in STEP will help the U.S. embassy contact them and provide assistance during an emergency overseas. U.S. government employees on official travel to Nepal must seek approval before traveling outside of Kathmandu Valley. Political-Related Violence: The potential for isolated political-related violence remains a real risk in Nepal. There are occasionally small-scale improvised explosive device (IED) incidents in various parts of Nepal, particularly during periods of heightened political tension. Reported incidents have not been directed toward Westerners or Western interests but have caused injury and damage to nearby individuals and property. The Embassy is also aware of extortion attempts and threats of violence by a local group against private businesses and aid organizations, including local and international schools within the Kathmandu Valley. Historically, violent political activity has been more prevalent in the Terai – the southern plains region of Nepal bordering India – than elsewhere in Nepal. Demonstrations have on occasion turned violent, although these activities generally have not been directed at U.S. citizens. Bandhs: Bandhs (general strikes) were formerly a common form of political agitation in Nepal but have occurred only infrequently in recent years. Bandhs are unpredictable, may include violent incidents, and can occur with little notice. They can cause schools and businesses to close and can stop traffic. Individuals not complying with bandhs may be harassed, and in extreme cases assaulted, by supporters. If you plan air travel to or from Nepal during a scheduled bandh, please note that transportation may be affected. Usually, bandh organizers allow specially marked buses operated by the Nepal Tourism Board to travel between the airport and major tourist hotels. Do not attend or approach political demonstrations or checkpoints established during bandhs. Avoid all unnecessary travel where bandhs are occurring. Actions to Take: Avoid all large gatherings, protests, and demonstrations. Report any difficulties or security concerns to police. Monitor local media for updates. Do not engage in argumentative or combative behavior if challenged or told that you cannot go to access a certain area. Keep a low profile. Be aware of your surroundings. Crime: Although relatively low, crime in Kathmandu and throughout the country has risen in some categories, including: Financial Crimes and Theft: Pickpocketing and bag-snatching may occur at major tourist sites, including the Thamel area of Kathmandu. Store valuables, including passports and cash, in the hotel safety deposit box; do not carry them. The Nepal Tourist Police recommend that you carry a photocopy of your passport when going out. Exchange money only at banks, hotels and government authorized money exchanger. Criminals use sophisticated scams, such as ATM skimming, particularly in Kathmandu. Avoid walking alone after dark, carrying large sums of cash, and wearing expensive jewelry. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Violent Crimes: Travel in groups, especially at night. While not common, sexual assaults against foreigners have been reported, including in popular tourist areas of Kathmandu and Pokhara, and in remote mountainous areas. Be aware of your surroundings. Foreigners have occasionally had sedative drugs added to their food or drink by individuals who seek to rob or otherwise take advantage of them. Solo travelers should take extra precautions to ensure their personal safety. We strongly recommend no solo trekking. Local guide service is available in trekking regions. Nepali police forces may have limited resources to deter and investigate crimes. Many criminal cases reported to the police remain unresolved. U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for information on available resources and assistance. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing “100"" as soon as incident occurs. This number is equivalent to “911” in the United States, and it is staffed 24/7 by the local police. When calling the emergency number, speak slowly and clearly so that your message gets across to the official without misunderstanding. Tourist Police , who can be reached by dialing “1144, +977-01-4247041 or +977-9851289444” have good English language capabilities and also stand ready to assist in popular tourism areas. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. For additional information, visit the State Department’s webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . U.S. citizen victims of crime in Nepal may always contact the U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu for assistance. Sexual assault victims might be more comfortable contacting the Embassy before reporting the crime to local authorities. In the event of a crime, the Embassy can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide a list of local attorneys Provide information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Tourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance and be aware of potential insurance fraud. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage insurance providers for overseas coverage .

For example, if dialed from the United States, the normal business hours number is 011-977-1-423-4000.)","General: Although availability of medical care has improved within the Kathmandu valley, outside the valley, it is limited and generally not up to Western standards. Medical facilities are often overwhelmed because of insufficient resources. Emergency medical services, especially in public hospitals, are of poor quality compared to that available in the United States. Routine medical issues and basic emergency surgeries can be performed by clinics and hospitals in Kathmandu. Serious illnesses, however, often require evacuation to the nearest adequate medical facility in a neighboring country. There is minimal mental health care available in Nepal. U.S. citizens with mental health problems are generally stabilized and transported to the United States or to another regional center for care. The U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu maintains a list of local medical facilities and practitioners . Intestinal tract diseases, including cholera, are present. Food hygiene and sanitary food handling practices are uncommon in Nepal, and precautions should be taken to prevent water and food-borne illnesses. Prudent travelers should avoid raw, green, leafy vegetables during the monsoon season. Malaria is present in the Terai region. For emergency services in Nepal, dial 102. Ambulance services are widely available in major cities, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards and is dependent on the quality of hospital from which the ambulance is dispatched. COVID-19 Testing: Local medical facilities, including outpatient labs, offer PCR COVID-19 tests on a cash basis, paid by the test recipient. Some facilities may offer in-home testing when arranged in advance. Average PCR test costs are $10-15, with expedited results offered for an additional fee. Most results are available within 48 hours. Expedited results may be available in as little as 6 hours. Results are typically sent via email and/or text message with a link to a .pdf file with scannable barcode. Local pharmacies generally stock rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, which typically cost $5-8. COVID-19 Vaccines: The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Nepal on an as-available basis through Nepal government. Those interested in receiving a COVID-19 vaccine should contact local ward authority. Medical providers in Nepal have been trained in English and most reception staff will be able to communicate in English. Visit the FDA's website to learn more about FDA-approved vaccines in the United States. Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy: Assisted Reproductive Technology services are widely available in Nepal and are generally safe. Surrogacy is illegal for foreigners and LGBTQI+ citizens in Nepal and is subject to complex local regulations. Be aware that individuals who attempt to circumvent local law risk criminal prosecution. Stray Animals: Stray animals are common on the streets of Kathmandu and at popular tourist sites. Visitors should be aware that stray animals may be infected with rabies. The CDC’s Preventing Dog Bites webpage recommends that if you are bitten by an animal, get to a safe place, immediately wash wounds with soap and water, and seek medical attention. The U.S. Embassy does not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Medical Insurance: Obtain emergency medical evacuation insurance before visiting Nepal. Serious medical issues and injuries suffered while hiking in remote areas may require evacuation by helicopter to Kathmandu. Those trekking in remote areas of Nepal should factor the high cost of a potential helicopter rescue into their financial considerations. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation, as medical evacuations can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Payment will be expected in cash before the medevac can take place, if there is no insurance coverage. Neither the U.S. Embassy nor the U.S. government pays private medical bills overseas. Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . BEWARE OF MEDEVAC SCAMS: Medevac scams are common in Nepal, particularly for those traveling in the popular trekking regions of Solukhumbu (Everest region) and Annapurna (Pokhara region). Unscrupulous trekking companies and medical providers may pressure trekkers experiencing mild altitude sickness effects to take medevac helicopter flights back to Kathmandu and be transported by ambulance to a hospital, then charged inflated costs to bill insurance companies, with the excess fees split between involved parties. Trekkers themselves are often knowingly involved in these scams. Such activities are illegal in Nepal, but rarely prosecuted and often difficult to discern in advance. Trekkers should use only TAAN-registered trekking agencies and seek information on costs for medical treatment in advance. Travelers should, however, be aware of the life-threatening risks involved with altitude sickness and err on the side of caution when receiving treatment. Prescription Medication: To avoid problems at port of entry, always carry prescribed medication in the original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription If traveling with prescription medication, check with the Embassy of Nepal to ensure that the medication is legal in Nepal. Local authorities irregularly enforce restrictions on certain drugs regularly prescribed by doctors in the United States or other foreign countries. To avoid problems, always carry prescription medication in the original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Vaccinations: Stay up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For further health information : World Health Organization WHO’s Nepal Profile U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) CDC’s Health Information for Travelers to Nepal","Arrests and Consequences: You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws in Nepal, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. If you are arrested in Nepal, the authorities may keep you in detention for weeks or even longer during the investigation stage. Punishment for violations of criminal laws in Nepal range from fines to imprisonment, depending on the crime. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Driving Under the Influence: Driving in Nepal after consuming any amount of alcohol could result in arrest. Illicit Drugs: A variety of illegal drugs are available in Nepal. Purchasing, possessing or consuming illegal drugs, including marijuana and hashish, could result in both fines and jail time. Firearms and Ammunition: You may not bring any kind of firearm or ammunition into Nepal. Violators who bring in firearms or ammunition – even imitations or in jewelry form – may be prosecuted. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES TREKKING IN NEPAL Solo Trekking: DO NOT TREK ALONE. The U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu strongly discourages U.S. citizens from hiking alone or even separating from larger traveling parties while on a trail. In recent years, U.S. citizens and other foreigners have disappeared, been seriously injured, or been victims of violent crime while trekking alone. In some cases, even after extensive search efforts, missing solo trekkers have not been found. The safest option for trekkers is to join an organized group and/or use a reputable trekking company that provides an experienced guide and porters who communicate in both Nepali and English. Effective April 1, 2023, new requirements established by the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) and more than a dozen trekking organizations, with the support of Nepal’s Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation, will require solo or foreign independent trekkers (FITs) to use a local guide from licensed trekking guide and obtain Trekking. Information Management System (TIMS) card through authorized trekking agencies registered with the Government of Nepal while trekking in Nepal’s official national parks and protected areas. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in considerable fines. Please review travel related information on the official websites of the Nepal Tourism Board and the U.S. Embassy-Kathmandu prior to travel. Natural Disaster Risks: Trekking in Nepal comes with the risk of natural disaster. DO NOT TREK ALONE. Trekkers should be alert to the possibility of avalanches, landslides, and falling rocks, even when trails are clear. Although these risks existed prior to the April 2015 earthquake and its aftershocks, earthquakes have further destabilized some mountainous areas, causing severe landslides in some affected areas. Altitude Risks: Everyone, regardless of age, experience, or fitness level, should exercise caution when trekking at high altitudes. Many popular trekking routes in Nepal cross passes as high as 18,000 feet. Only experienced mountain climbers should tackle the Himalayas. DO NOT TREK ALONE. Acclimatization is best achieved by walking slowly, rather than hurrying, to cover the distance at high altitudes. Without acclimatization, trekkers of all ages, experience, and fitness levels can experience acute mountain sickness (AMS), which can be deadly. Speak with your doctor or medical professionals in Kathmandu for specific recommendations. We strongly recommend supplemental travel and evacuation insurance. Consult carefully with trekking agencies for current, location-specific information, and heed warnings of potential danger. Provide family or friends with a detailed itinerary prior to trekking and check in at all police checkpoints where trekking permits are logged. Register your itinerary through the STEP enrollment process. Before leaving Kathmandu, trekkers can check with the Himalayan Rescue Association (phone: +977-1-444-0292/444-0293) for reliable information about trail conditions and potential hazards of traveling in the Himalayas. We strongly recommend supplemental travel and evacuation insurance. Altitude Risks: Everyone, regardless of age, experience, or fitness level, should exercise caution when trekking at high altitudes. Many popular trekking routes in Nepal cross passes as high as 18,000 feet. Only experienced mountain climbers should tackle the Himalayas. DO NOT TREK ALONE. Acclimatization is best achieved by walking slowly, rather than hurrying, to cover the distance at high altitudes. Without acclimatization, trekkers of all ages, experience, and fitness levels can experience acute mountain sickness (AMS), which can be deadly. Speak with your doctor or medical professionals in Kathmandu for specific recommendations. We strongly recommend supplemental travel and evacuation insurance. Evacuation by Helicopter: Obtain emergency medical evacuation insurance before visiting Nepal. Many foreigners require or request evacuation by helicopter from Nepal’s rugged mountain terrain. Most hospitality employees along trekking routes can connect you with a helicopter evacuation service provider. Helicopter companies will generally require either specific evacuation insurance, pre-approval from your health insurance, or payment upfront by credit card in order to assist. Carry appropriate insurance and travel with credit card information. If you hope to have health insurance pay large bills without pre-approval, please note that the service provider may ask to hold onto your passport pending receipt of payment. Lodging and Travel: During peak trekking seasons, generally spring and autumn, hotel rooms may become scarce. Make advance booking for hotel rooms and plan for possible flight/airport delays. Domestic air flight cancellations and delays occur frequently because of bad weather, including to and from Lukla (gateway to the Everest Base Camp trek) and Jomsom (gateway to the Mustang region). Leave ample time to catch outbound international flights when connecting from domestic flights. Be aware that many hotels in Nepal do not meet international fire or earthquake safety standards. TIMS Card and Trekking Permits: The Government of Nepal has authorized the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) to implement a system for foreign hikers called the Trekkers’ Information Management System (TIMS). Foreign visitors on hiking trips in Nepal, including those not with organized hiking groups, are required to have a valid TIMS card through authorized trekking agencies registered with the Government of Nepal. In case of an emergency, this system helps authorities find trekkers. Special Permits for Restricted Areas: Trekking in certain remote areas of Nepal and in national parks may require additional permits or fees. Travelers may consult with an experienced tour agency, or review the website of the Nepali Department of Immigration for more information. Please be aware that restricted areas have special requirements for helicopter rescue flights, which may delay assistance even in the event of a medical emergency. Other Outdoor Activities: Nepal offers many exciting outdoor activities that come with a variety of risks. Several tourists have drowned while swimming in Phewa Lake near Pokhara and other lakes in Nepal because of flash floods triggered by monsoon rains, or after becoming entangled in submerged tree branches or roots. Incidents of boats capsizing on choppy water have also occurred. Wear life jackets. Paragliding and ultralight aircraft tourism have become popular in Pokhara, and many new companies offer such services. Weigh the risks involved with paragliding and ultralight aircraft travel; safety standards may or may not follow international best practices. When engaging in adventure activities, Embassy personnel are strongly encouraged to use professional guide services and to carry a Personnel Tracker Locator device. There are also a number of deep and dangerous ravines not clearly visible to pedestrians in Pokhara city, mainly in the outlying areas. Some local residents and foreigners have fallen into these ravines and sustained serious injuries or died. Medical care is limited and often does not meet Western standards. Volunteering: Nepal’s Department of Immigration considers volunteering as work, and thus requires volunteers to obtain a work visa. Volunteering on a tourist visa is illegal, and can result in detention by immigration authorities, fines, expulsion from Nepal, and lengthy bans on returning to Nepal. Some visitors to Nepal wish to volunteer at orphanages or other organizations in an effort to help disadvantaged persons – especially children. Others try to help by donating cash or goods. While we applaud this generous spirit, we are aware of reports that many such opportunities – especially those involving volunteering at orphanages or “children’s homes” – are not in fact charities. Instead, they are for-profit enterprises set up to attract donations from abroad and financial support from volunteers. Many of the children are reportedly not orphans, and volunteering at such an organization may indirectly contribute to child exploitation by creating a demand for children who may be trafficked to such locations. Prospective volunteers in Nepal should read a recent report prepared by a U.S.-based NGO in Nepal regarding ethical volunteering , with a focus on issues relating to “voluntourism.” It can be difficult even for those with significant experience in Nepal to determine which organizations provide authentic and valuable opportunities for well-meaning volunteers, and which manipulate goodwill for profit. With respect to orphanages or children’s homes, the Nepali National Child Rights Council can help confirm an organization’s legitimacy. You can direct inquiries to Ms. Namuna Bhusal, namuna@ncrc.gov.np , +977-9851139474. The NCRC also handles complaints against children’s homes. U.S. citizens should be aware that the Government of Nepal has limited resources to monitor and regulate non-profit organizations. If you are not certain about an organization, you may want to consider routing contributions through a reputable national or international charity to avoid the possibility that your time and money could unknowingly support the exploitation of children. Learn more about best practices for volunteering abroad . Currency and Money Issues: The Government of Nepal requires travelers to declare either the import or export of currency that exceeds US$5,000 USD in value by filling out a customs declaration form. The Embassy is not aware of any banks or money exchange offices in Nepal that accept U.S.-issued travelers checks or cash U.S. checks. Accordingly, travelers should consider alternative methods of accessing local currency (e.g., exchanging cash U.S. dollars for Nepali rupees at a bank or money exchange office, or withdrawing rupees from an ATM). Travelers should ensure that they keep a copy of the declaration form after customs officials have put the official endorsement and appropriate stamps on the form to prevent any problems upon departure. Please note that this requirement is subject to change and travelers should contact the Embassy of Nepal in Washington, D.C. to obtain the latest information. Carrying Indian currency in denominations greater than 100 rupees notes is illegal/restricted in Nepal. Consequences for violating this requirement generally include seizure of all cash, gold, or jewelry carried, as well as fines and imprisonment. travelers coming to Nepal from India who hope to change Indian currency into Nepali Rupees are advised to bring 100 Indian Rupee notes or lower denominations only. Please note that Nepali Rupees cannot be exchanged outside of Nepal. See the section below on Customs regarding prohibitions on the importation of gold and silver. Customs: Do not carry any amount of pure gold, more than 50 grams of gold jewelry, or more than 100 grams of silver into Nepal. You will be detained, the valuables will be seized, and you will need to pay a fine equivalent to the full value of the items seized in order to be released. Nepal customs regulations are complex. Customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning importation (even temporarily) and exportation of certain items. Do not carry other valuable metals, articles of archaeological or religious significance, wildlife or related items, drugs, or weapons and ammunition. Do extensive research before importing household pets (including cats and dogs), communications equipment, and other items that might be perceived as sensitive. Drones are strictly regulated throughout Nepal and require special permission from the Home Ministry and other government authorities. Items purported to be for donation to schools, hospitals, and other social organizations have sometimes been confiscated or cleared only after payment of a significant fine for failure to obtain prior approval from the Ministry of Finance . Those wishing to donate items to a charity or any organization in Nepal must obtain prior approval for waiver of the custom fees from the Ministry of Finance by sending a formal request letter (not via email) to the following address: Spokesperson: Mr. Ananda Kafle Ministry of Finance Singha Durbar Kathmandu, Nepal Tel: +977-1- 4200537 Email: moev@mof.gov.np The request should include detailed information about the items to be imported, as well as the organizations receiving the donations. The Secretary will review the request and refer it to the Ministerial level for final decision and approval. Note that all requests are processed on a case-by-case basis. It is highly recommended that intended recipient(s) coordinate with the Ministry to get requests processed. Please see additional information about Customs and Import Restrictions. Dual Nationality: Nepal does not recognize dual nationality. Accordingly, when a Nepali citizen naturalizes as a U.S. citizen, he/she loses his/her Nepali citizenship. Some travelers who have tried to maintain both U.S. and Nepali passports have faced difficulties entering or exiting Nepal. U.S. citizens of Nepali descent may be eligible for a special visa called a “Non-Resident Nepali” or “NRN” Identity Card. The NRN Identity Card allows a holder to open a local bank account, invest, and own certain types of property, subject to certain restrictions. For more information, contact the Nepali Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Embassy of Nepal in the United States. Natural Disasters: Nepal lies on an active fault zone and is considered at high-risk for major earthquakes, as demonstrated by the April and May 2015 earthquakes that caused extensive damage in the Kathmandu Valley and other districts. Lack of adequate emergency response vehicles, equipment, and medical facilities, combined with building codes that are not strictly enforced, may multiply the extent of possible catastrophic damage from a major earthquake, especially in the Kathmandu Valley. Nepal is also prone to flooding and landslides. The Government of Nepal’s ability to respond in the event of a natural disaster may be limited. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) . In Case of Emergency or Natural Disaster: Monitor us on Twitter and Facebook for updates. Call us in Washington at 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada or 1-202-501-4444 from other countries from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays). Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program ( STEP ) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency. Faith-Based Travelers: As of August 2018, religious conversion and proselytization are illegal in Nepal. See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Rights: Same-sex sexual activity is not criminalized, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons in Nepal actively and openly advocate for their rights. Nepal, however, remains a conservative and traditional society. Discrimination exists, and reports of non-violent harassment of LGBTI persons have been received. Accordingly, LGBTI travelers may wish to be discreet and avoid public displays of affection. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for additional details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation difficult throughout Nepal. Nepali law prohibits discrimination against persons who have physical and mental disabilities, including discrimination in employment, education, access to health care, and in the provision of other state services. The law mandates access to buildings, transportation, employment, education, and other state services, but these provisions generally are not enforced. Nepal’s poor infrastructure makes it impracticable in many cases for a mobility-impaired traveler to move around the country, including within the Kathmandu Valley. The government is largely ineffective in implementing or enforcing laws regarding persons with disabilities. Except for a few clinics and hospitals, Nepal mostly lacks accessible and appropriate accommodation for individuals with disabilities. Students: See the Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips .

Netherlands,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Crime: While the rate of violent crime in the Netherlands is low, tourists are often targeted by pickpockets, bag snatchers, and other petty thieves and are active in and around train, tram, and metro stations in city centers; and aboard public transportation, especially to and from Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport. Thieves often work in pairs: one distracts you, often by asking for directions, while the other moves in on your unguarded property. Use your hotel safe, and keep baggage locked or secured when you are away. Avoid leaving valuables in automobiles, especially electronic devices, such as laptops, tablets, GPS devices, and mobile telephones. Never leave your personal items or baggage unattended. Most retailers in the Netherlands only accept a “chip and pin” card and will not accept a standard U.S. credit card containing only a magnetic strip. ATM and credit card users are advised to keep an eye on their cards at all times. If you feel uncomfortable using your card for any reason, use cash. Contact your credit card provider for further guidance. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

Although surrogacy agencies/clinics claim surrogacy is legal in New Zealand, there is little legal framework for foreigners or same-sex couples to pursue surrogacy in New Zealand. As a result, surrogacy agreements between foreign or same-sex intending parents and gestational mothers may not be enforced by New Zealand courts. You may be required to adopt the child before you are given parental rights. If you decide to pursue parenthood in New Zealand via assisted reproductive technology (ART) with a gestational mother, be prepared for long and unexpected delays in documenting your child’s citizenship.

The volcano remains active and further eruptions are possible. Avoid Whakaari/White Island and follow the advice of local authorities. There are many areas in New Zealand with active volcanoes. Tourists are encouraged to visit GeoNet for up-to-date information on volcanic alert levels, as well as other geological hazards in New Zealand. As always, follow the advice of local authorities. The National Emergency Management Agency provides timely information to citizens and visitors through an Emergency Mobile Alert . This service is broadcast from local cell towers to all capable phones in the area and is designed to provide targeted messaging to areas affected by serious hazards. Messages will only be sent when there is a serious threat to life, health, or property. Adventure Sports: Injuries and death can result from participating in extreme adventure sports, such as bungee jumping, sky diving, hiking, rappelling, climbing, motorcycling, and kayaking. Use caution and common sense when engaging in these activities. Make sure you have travel medical insurance and that it covers your sport. Never participate in adventure sports alone. Always carry identification and let someone else know where you are at all times. Before kayaking, check the river conditions and wear a life jacket. When hiking, rappelling, or climbing, carry a first aid kit and know the location of the nearest rescue center. Visit the New Zealand Department of Conservation website for advice and direction on how to safely and legally hike, bike, etc. in New Zealand. Imports: New Zealand is an island nation, and the government is serious about preserving its delicate ecosystem. The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) strictly regulates what can be imported into New Zealand. If you do not declare goods that could be quarantined, you can be fined up to NZD $100,000 and/or face up to five years in prison. If you do not declare goods considered to be a biosecurity risk, such as honey, fresh fruit, seeds, and plants, you can receive an instant fine of NZD $400.

The law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and access to services. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, and general infrastructure. Every new building and major reconstruction in New Zealand must provide ""reasonable and adequate"" access for individuals with disabilities, but be aware that most buildings pre-date this requirement. Most facilities have wheelchair access. Many transport operators can provide accessible transport, but most need advance notice so you may want to call ahead to describe your needs. Mobility parking permits are available. If you are planning a holiday and need information on facilities for individuals with disabilities, please visit the New Zealand Tourism website. Rental, repair and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices may be limited. Service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants are available in many areas.

Nicaragua,"The Government of Nicaragua is authoritarian, limits freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, represses internal dissent, and monitors and responds to perceived threats to its authority.  Nicaragua’s Sovereign Security Law and its Terrorism and Money Laundering law allow for discretionary interpretation of often vaguely defined unlawful activities, such as threatening the peace and economic stability of Nicaragua.  Convictions under these laws have often been arbitrary and result in long prison sentences. Nicaraguan authorities and armed civilians in plain clothes known as “para police” may monitor, detain, deny entry to, expel, or question U.S. citizens concerning their activities, including their contact with Nicaraguan citizens.  Visitors should avoid any commentary on Nicaraguan politics or governance.  Nicaraguan authorities have subjected U.S. citizens, including dual U.S.-Nicaraguan citizens, to prolonged detentions which are often politically motivated or arbitrary.  Especially in politically motivated arrests, the judicial process has regularly been criticized as neither fair nor transparent. Demonstrations or strikes may occur throughout the country; in the past, the Nicaraguan government has violently suppressed them.  Avoid demonstrations and exercise extreme caution around large gatherings. Roads may be closed, and public transportation may be disrupted due to large crowds celebrating the following holidays: Semana Santa (the week before Easter); Repliegue Historico a Masaya (early July); July 19 celebration of the Sandinista Revolution; Celebration in Managua of Santo Domingo, the Patron Saint of the city (August 1st and August 10th); Day of the Nicaraguan Army (September 2); Nicaraguan Independence Day (September 14 and 15); and Immaculate Conception (December 8). Crime: Vehicle burglaries, pick-pocketing, and occasional armed robberies occur in store parking lots, on public transportation, and in open-air markets like the Oriental and Huembes Markets in Managua.  Petty street crime is common.  Police presence is extremely limited outside of major urban areas.  The Caribbean Coast’s geographical isolation further limits the U.S. Embassy’s ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens living in or visiting the area. Uniformed police and para-police commit violence and intimidate civilians throughout the country for political reasons. U.S. citizens have been sexually assaulted in beach resort areas. There are no forensic doctors on the Corn Islands , so victims of violent crimes, including sexual assault, must travel to Bluefields at their own expense for medical examinations and collection of evidence.  In several recent cases, police were reluctant to produce police reports or pursue charges .  Please report such incidents to the Embassy. Medical services outside Managua are limited, including for victims of crime. Exercise extreme caution when renting or driving vehicles. In one common scam, “Good Samaritans” pull over to help change a flat tire.  While the driver is distracted, an accomplice steals the driver’s possessions. Due to crime and other illicit activity, U.S. government personnel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are prohibited from entering Managua’s Oriental Market and gentlemen’s clubs throughout the country. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI page for information. Victims of Crime: Report crimes, including sexual assault, to the local police at 118 (Nicaraguan equivalent of “911,” in Spanish).  Report serious crimes to the U.S. Embassy at 2252-7100 immediately and minor crimes during business hours.

Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador have maritime and land disputes over islands and access to fishing rights in the Gulf of Fonseca on the Pacific Coast, a closed sea under international law. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are uncommon.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in major cities.  In the event of a diving injury, the only hyperbaric chamber is in Puerto Cabezas, over 100 miles from Corn Island where most tourists dive.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . Beach Safety: Exercise caution at the beach. U.S. citizens have drowned at Nicaraguan beaches, and in lagoons and lakes. Warning signs are not always posted.  Lifeguards and rescue equipment are not normally available. Hiking in volcanic or remote areas is dangerous.  Wear appropriate clothing and footwear.  Carry sufficient food, water, and communication equipment.  If you travel to remote areas, hire a reputable local guide. Nicaraguan law requires tourists hire a local guide for several volcanoes, including the two volcanoes on Ometepe Island (Maderas and Concepcion). Disaster Preparedness: Nicaragua is prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and volcanic eruptions.  If you are at a coastal area when an earthquake occurs, move swiftly to higher ground (when safe to do so) to avoid possible tsunamis. In the event of an earthquake, volcanic eruption, or other natural disaster, U.S. citizens should pay close attention to local media reports. Follow the guidance of local authorities and monitor the websites of the Nicaraguan Institute for Territorial Studies ( INETER ) and the Nicaraguan Emergency Alert System ( SINAPRED ).

Niger,"Travelers to Niger are urged to exercise extreme caution due to the risk of terror attacks and kidnapping threats against Westerners. U.S. citizens should reduce exposure to locations frequented by Westerners such as restaurants and nightclubs. Visitors are urged to stay in hotels with armed Nigerien security presence. Due to security threats, the U.S. Embassy restricts the travel of U.S. government employees and official visitors outside of Niamey. These restrictions may limit the ability of the U.S. Embassy to assist visitors in these areas. The border region with Mali continues to be of specific concern. There are frequent and ongoing reports of terrorists and affiliates crossing into and through Niger from Mali. A U.S. citizen was kidnapped from the area in October 2016. Niger’s southeastern border with Nigeria and east of Maradi are poorly controlled. Boko Haram and several factions affiliated with ISIS have conducted cross-border attacks into Niger. The Government of Niger has increased its security forces in the border areas, but the situation remains unstable and travel is not advised. For travel in any remote area of the country, the Department of State urges travelers to use guides and to travel with a minimum of two vehicles equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) and satellite phones. Street demonstrations occur frequently in Niger. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational without warning. Avoid demonstrations and maintain security awareness at all times. Refer to the U.S. Embassy Niger website for the most updated safety and security information. Crime: Thefts and petty crimes are common day or night. Tourists should not walk alone in Niger, but areas in Niamey near the Gaweye Hotel, the National Museum, the Petit Marché, and on or near the Kennedy Bridge are of particular concern. In general, walking at night is not recommended. Counterfeit and pirated goods are available, but transactions involving such products may be illegal under local law. Carrying them back to the United States may result in forfeitures and/or fines. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime abroad, contact the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. There is no local equivalent to a “911” emergency line in Niger. U.S. citizens can try calling local police by dialing “17” on Nigerien phones or +227-20-72-25-53, but calls to these numbers often go unanswered, especially outside of normal working hours. The Embassy highly recommends hiring guards for your residence if you are planning to live in Niger. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .","Health and emergency services are extremely limited in Niamey, and completely inadequate outside the capital.  Air quality is poor in Niamey.  Travelers with respiratory conditions are cautioned that they may experience worsening symptoms in Niger. Documentation of yellow fever vaccination is required for those over nine months of age upon arrival in Niger. Mosquito borne illnesses such as malaria are the leading cause of dealth in Niger. Documentation of yellow fever immunization is required for travelers prior to arrival in Niger. Zika virus is a risk in Niger.  Because Zika infection in a pregnant woman can cause birth defects;  pregnant women should not visit Niger.  All travelers should follow steps to prevent mosquito bites and sexual exposure to Zika during and after the trip.

Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: There is strong societal stigma against same-sex sexual activity in Niger, but no laws criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual activity in general.  The law states, however, that an “unnatural act” with a person of the same sex who is under 21 is punishable by six months to three years in prison and a fine of between 9,000 and 90,000 CFA francs ($16-$160). See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Dress restrictions: Local culture and Islamic tradition encourage conservative dress for both men and women. There have been incidents of groups of men assaulting women who appear to be African and who are wearing clothing other than traditional garments. Photography restrictions: Tourists are free to take pictures anywhere in Niger, except near military installations, radio and television stations, the Presidential Palace, airports, or diplomatic facilities. Tourists should not photograph military or police personnel, or political or student demonstrations, and should seek prior permission before taking a close-up “portrait” photo of an individual. Currency regulations: Niger shares the West African Franc (CFA) with several other West African countries. The CFA may be converted into dollars. Foreign currency exchange over 1 million CFA (about $1,900 at an exchange rate of about 530 CFA/$1) requires authorization from the Ministry of Finance (forms available from all major banks). Telephone service: Due to poor line quality, callers often experience delays in getting a telephone line, and faxes are often unclear. Service quality is generally better with cellular service, which is available from multiple providers in urban areas. Connections between cell phones and land lines are often poor quality and may fail to connect at all. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Nigerien law mandates that the state provide for persons with physical and mental disabilities, but there are no specific regulations mandating accessibility to buildings, transportation, and communication for those with special needs. There is extremely limited accessibility to public transportation, road crossings, taxis, restaurants, cafes, bars, and other tourist spots. Students: See our Students Abroad page. Women Travelers: Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in Niger is punished by a fine and a jail sentence. Between 1998 and 2006 the practice of FGM on girls aged 15 to 49 was reduced by 50% (5% to 2.2%) although ethnic and regional disparities remain, with a pocket of the most intense FGM practice persisting in far Western Niger. Forced marriage or marriage without the consent of one or both parties still happens in Niger, and victims are often minor 15-18 year old girls. Women have limited access to education and employment (less than 15% of women can read.) See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Nigeria,"Terrorism : Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack –including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Please see our most recent Travel Advisory for more details. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime : Muggings, assaults, burglaries, car-jackings, rape, kidnappings, and extortion occur regularly. Law enforcement authorities usually respond slowly and often do not have the resources to provide investigative support to victims. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens beyond Abuja and Lagos and their immediate surrounding areas. U.S. government employees may be subject to travel constraints as security conditions warrant. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams :  See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Nigeria. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters.  Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/online dating Money transfers Contracts with promises of large commissions Inheritance notices Nigerian Letter or “419” Fraud Victims of Crime :  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Abuja or Consulate General in Lagos for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 112, and contact the Embassy at +(234)(9)461-4328 or Consulate General at +(234)(1) 460-3400. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. Justice in Nigeria may be uneven. Many crimes go unsolved. Others may not be prosecuted to a successful conclusion for the victim. See our webpage on help for U.S. citizen victims of crime overseas . We can: Help you find appropriate medical care. Assist you in reporting a crime to the police. Contact relatives or friends with your written consent. Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion. Provide a list of local attorneys. Provide information on victims’ compensation programs in the United States . Provide information on victims’ assistance programs in Nigeria: National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons ( NAPTIP ) Women Trafficking and Child Labor Eradication Foundation ( WOTCLEF ) Women at Risk International Foundation ( WARIF ) Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution. Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home. Replace a stolen or lost passport. Domestic Violence : U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy or Consulate for assistance. Tourism : The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. Even within major cities, the limited number of first responders and extreme traffic congestion can cause lengthy delays in response time. Emergency services comparable to those in the United States or Europe are non-existent, and the blood supply is unreliable and unsafe for transfusion. You should consider traveling to the United States, Europe, or South Africa for treatment for serious conditions.  U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance . Maritime Security : Piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea continue to trend upwards. Pirates/armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property continue to be common occurrences.","Nigerian medical facilities are generally poorly equipped. Many medicines are unavailable, including medications for diabetes or asthma. Take care when purchasing medicines locally, as counterfeit pharmaceuticals are a common problem, and may be difficult to distinguish from genuine medications. Hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services. Emergency services comparable to those in the United States or Europe are non-existent, and the blood supply is unreliable and unsafe for transfusion. For serious medical problems, you should consider traveling to the United States, Europe, or South Africa for treatment. For emergency services in Nigeria, dial 112. Ambulance services are: not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas. not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. We do not pay medical bills . Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance : Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on types of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria to ensure the medication is legal in Nigeria. Vaccinations : Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further Health Information : World Health Organization (WHO) U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) https://healthapp.ncdc.gov.ng/guidelines-and-protocols/ https://healthapp.ncdc.gov.ng/health-declaration-page/ The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Health Facilities in General : Adequate health facilities are available in major cities, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies. Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment. Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient. Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff are available overnight (in non-emergency wards). Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, and approaches to treatment and services might be significantly different than the United States. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery : Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry worldwide. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for information on medical tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Nigeria. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Nigeria. Pharmaceuticals : Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescriptions in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Non-Traditional Medicine : U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners.  We recommend that you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities in such cases. Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy : If you are considering traveling to Nigeria to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our ART and Surrogacy Abroad page . Although surrogacy agencies/clinics claim surrogacy is legal in Nigeria, there is no legal framework for foreigners to pursue surrogacy in Nigeria. As a result, surrogacy agreements between foreign intending parents and gestational mothers vary widely and are not enforced by Nigerian courts. Even though you may have a surrogacy contract, it is not clear if the contract will stand in court as a custody agreement. Therefore, parents should consider obtaining a custody order in Nigeria to be certain their parental rights are recognized. Surrogacy for same-sex couples is illegal in Nigeria. If you decide to pursue parenthood in Nigeria via assisted reproductive technology (ART) with a gestational mother, be prepared for long delays in documenting your child’s citizenship. Be aware that individuals who attempt to circumvent local law risk criminal prosecution. Water Quality : Tap water is unsafe.  Bottled water and beverages are generally safe.  Be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested, and  may use tap water to make ice for drinks. Adventure Travel : Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel . General Health : The following diseases are prevalent: Chickenpox Cholera Dengue Diarrheal illness Hepatitis A Hepatitis B HIV/AIDS Lassa Fever Loiasis Malaria Measles Meningococcal meningitis Mumps Pertussis Polio Rabies Rubella Schistosomiasis Tetanus Trypanosomiasis Tuberculosis Typhoid Yellow fever The U.S. Centers for Disease Control lists Nigeria as “critically high risk” for Malaria. Malaria is especially fatal in Nigeria and accounts for a high burden of disease and death in travelers. All travelers should take chemoprophylaxis, even for short stays, and even if they are African by descent. Avoid being outdoors during dusk and dawn and wear clothing over exposed skin whenever possible. Sleep with windows closed and under air conditioning. Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in Nigeria. Air Quality : Reliable air quality data for Nigeria is limited. However, satellite data suggests that on average it is significantly worse than in the United States. Poor waste management practices and commercial pollution exacerbate seasonal weather variations that affect air quality. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you, and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons.  It is typically at its worst from the end of November to mid-March, which is the harmattan season (a very dry season in West Africa when winds blow sand and dust from the Sahara Desert). People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens. People over 65 years of age. People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. People with heart disease or diabetes. People who work or are active outdoors. Travelers with allergies and/or respiratory disease may experience illness and are encouraged to bring ample supply of prescription medications.","Criminal Penalties : You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Possession, use, or sale of cannabis and related products is prohibited under Nigerian law.  U.S. citizens who violate the law may be subject to arrest and prosecution. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General immediately. In cases where detainees are dual citizens (holders of U.S. and Nigerian citizenship), the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General may not be promptly notified. See our webpage for further information. Faith-Based Travelers :  See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers : Consensual, same-sex sexual relations are illegal in Nigeria. Entering same-sex marriage contracts and civil unions (defined to include “any arrangement between persons of the same sex to live together as sex partners”) is also criminalized, with punishments including fines and prison sentences of up to 14 years. Same-sex marriage contracts and civil unions entered into in a foreign country are not recognized under Nigerian law. Public displays of affection between persons of the same sex are also punishable by up to ten years imprisonment. Furthermore, the law allows for the prosecution of persons who support or belong to advocacy groups relating to LGBTI issues, with prison sentences of up to ten years. U.S. citizens who participate in free speech or assemblies relating to same-sex marriage could potentially be prosecuted under this law. In the following northern states, where Sharia law applies, penalties can also include death: Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Niger, Sokoto, Yobe, and Zamfara. See our LGBTI Travel Information page. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Nigeria prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities; however, the law is very unevenly enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Few government buildings, schools, banks, or grocery stores have accessible facilities, including in Abuja and Lagos. Some hospitals and clinics are equally inaccessible to people with disabilities and lack wheelchair ramps or lifts, including some of the hospitals travelers commonly use. Expect accessibility to be very limited in transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure, and largely absent outside of major cities. Much of the disability equipment for sale locally is refurbished rather than new. Replacement parts can be found in local informal markets and are also generally refurbished parts. Imported higher-end equipment such as electric wheelchairs and lifting equipment can be purchased from a limited number of medical equipment suppliers in the major cities. Students :  See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers :  Rape is a crime in Nigeria. According to the Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) Act, rape is punishable by 12 years to life imprisonment for offenders older than 14 and a maximum of 14 years imprisonment for offenders younger than 14. Rape remains a rampant problem. The VAPP Act, currently applicable only in the Federal Capital Territory, addresses sexual, physical, psychological, and socioeconomic violence, and harmful traditional practices. Federal law criminalizes female circumcision or genital mutilation (FGM/C). Twelve states have also banned FGM/C, though the practice remains common in parts of both Northern and Southern Nigeria. See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
North Korea,"Please see the sections on “Local Laws and Special Circumstances” and “Criminal Penalties.” Crime: North Korea does not release crime statistics. Petty thefts have been reported at the airport in Pyongyang. Do not buy counterfeit and/or pirated goods, even if they are widely available. The purchase of counterfeit and pirated goods is illegal in the United States and may be illegal in North Korea. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Report the crime to your local host/liaison and contact the Embassy of Sweden for assistance. Your local host/liaison should contact the local authorities on your behalf. Lost or Stolen Passports : If your passport is lost or stolen in North Korea, you will need to contact the Embassy of Sweden in Pyongyang, U.S. Protecting Power, for assistance in reaching out to a U.S. Embassy or Consulate and obtaining a replacement passport. You will also need a replacement visa for China. Please see our information for victims of crime , including possible victim compensation programs in the United States . Tourism: Individuals cannot use a U.S. passport to travel to, in, or through North Korea without a special validation from the Department of State. Special Validations are granted only if it is in the US national interest to do so. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .","If you have medical problems, do not travel to North Korea: Medical facilities in the DPRK lack resources and electricity. Medical personnel have inadequate or outdated skills. Hospitals in Pyongyang can perform basic examinations and lifesaving measures, but functioning x-ray facilities are not generally available. Avoid surgery. If you have an accident outside Pyongyang, transport back to the capital can be lengthy and without medical assistance. Hospitals will expect immediate U.S. dollar cash payment for medical treatment . You cannot use credit cards or checks in the DPRK. Carry your regular medication with you along with the doctor’s prescription: DPRK Customs says that most prescription medication may be brought into the country with no restrictions. Medical Evacuations: Local DPRK hosts are often not aware of options available for medical evacuations and might claim that no such options exist. Insist on contacting the Embassy of Sweden, which will attempt to arrange flight clearances for air ambulances performing emergency medical evacuations. Costs for medical air evacuation vary, but according to SOS International, an evacuation from Pyongyang to Beijing averages approximately USD 40,000 including medical personnel (1 doctor and 1 nurse), the aircraft, and clearance costs. The General Bureau of the Koryo Civil Aviation of the DPRK says that it provides around-the-clock service and that requests for air clearance will be granted within 24 hours. If a U.S. citizen with a medical emergency is in Pyongyang, the Embassy of Sweden can usually arrange a medical evacuation to Beijing in one day.  If the patient is located outside Pyongyang, it will take longer. Medical evacuation by regularly scheduled airlines can be arranged, but very few flights operate from Pyongyang to Beijing (Air Koryo and Air China), Shenyang (Air Koryo), or Vladivostok (Air Koryo). Air Koryo flights go to Shanghai only on a charter basis in the tourist season (April-October). In order to transit China, Chinese visas for injured foreigners and any escorts must be obtained prior to the evacuation from North Korea. Even in the case of a medical emergency, transit visas may take several days to arrange. Evacuation across the DMZ to South Korea is not allowed. Vaccinations: Information on vaccinations and other health precautions, such as safe food and water precautions and insect bite protection are located at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s hotline for international travelers at 1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747) or via the CDC Internet site. For information about outbreaks of infectious diseases abroad, consult the World Health Organization's (WHO) website . If you have special dietary requirements, you are advised to bring food with you to North Korea, as the restaurants available to foreigners have limited menus that may not meet your dietary needs. Companies that may be able to arrange evacuation services include, but are not limited to, those listed below. You may wish to contact these or other emergency medical assistance providers for information about their ability to provide medical evacuation insurance and/or assistance for travelers to North Korea. International SOS Telephone (inside China):  400-818-0767 Telephone (outside China): (86-10) 6462-9100 United Healthcare Global Assistance Telephone:  (U.S.) (410) 453-6330 Telephone:  (Toll free within China) 10-8888-800-527-0218 Telephone:  (outside China) (86-10) 6595-8510) You can find useful information on medical emergencies abroad, including overseas insurance programs, on the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs website. Also, see our extensive tips and advice on Traveling Safely Abroad . Bills - We do not pay medical bills . Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas: The DPRK says U.S. citizens are accountable for costs associated with detention or incarceration in North Korea such as lodging, food, telephone calls, and medical assistance (hospital bills). Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . We strongly recommend supplemental insurance (our webpage) to cover medical evacuation.

See our webpage for further information Educate yourself about North Korean law . The North Korea legal system is an instrument of state power and not an independent branch of the government.  Protections guaranteed under the U.S. legal system do not apply, and your U.S. passport does not confer special status. Your local host/liaison may be able to provide useful guidance. However, do not assume your host will provide assistance to you if you are arrested, or that any information you shared with your host will not be turned over to North Korean authorities. Criminal acts unique to North Korea: Showing disrespect (both physically and verbally) to the country’s former leaders, Kil Il Sung or Kim Jong Il, or the country’s current leader, Kim Jong Un including but not limited to tampering with or mishandling materials bearing their names or images such as money, newspapers, or political slogans in Korean Entering North Korea without proper travel documentation Possessing material, printed or digital including e-book readers, DVDs, USB drives, documents, literature, audio and video files that is critical of or hostile to North Korea Proselytizing or carrying out religious activities, including activities that may be construed as such, like leaving behind religious materials, either intentionally or unintentionally Engaging in unsanctioned political activities Unauthorized interacting with North Koreans Taking unauthorized photographs Having unauthorized conversations with North Koreans Traveling without authorization even for short distances Exchanging currency with an unauthorized vendor Shopping at stores not designated for foreigners Bringing pornography into the country No Expectation of Privacy: All electronic and multimedia devices including USB drives, CDs, DVDs, mobile phones, tablets, laptops, Internet browsing histories, and cookies are subject to search for banned content.

Some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES Press: North Korea officials watch journalists closely to prevent them from unauthorized conversations with North Koreans or questioning the policies, actions, or public statements of North Korea’s leadership. North Korea has confiscated objectionable material from foreign journalists. Journalists who engaged in activities that challenged the regime have been deported, arrested, or detained to face criminal charges. For additional information on the lack of freedom of information in North Korea, see the Department of State’s Human Rights Report for North Korea . U.S. Government Economic Sanctions Against North Korea: North Korea remains one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world. The government of North Korea and the Workers’ Party of Korea are blocked persons, and U.S. citizens may generally not engage in transactions with them or with their property. Most exports to North Korea are subject to licensing by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security. The importation and exportation of goods, services, and technology from or to North Korea are generally prohibited unless authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and, for exports or goods, the Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security. UN Security Council statements November 17, 2017: For information on the United States and the United Nations Security Council concern regarding escalating tensions from the recent  missile launch, and other activities prohibited by United Nations Security Council Resolutions, see UN website .

Faith-Based Travelers: See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report . LGBTI Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations because same-sex sexual relations are considered a foreign phenomenon.  DPRK claims that there are no LGBTI in the country. It would therefore not be possible to organize an LGBTI event here. Additionally, any open demonstration of affection is frowned upon, as well as between opposite sex couples. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of the Department of State's Human Rights report for further details. Persons with Mobility Issues .

Norway,"Terroris m: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Norway has a low level of crime and violent crime is uncommon. The most likely forms of crime, especially in the Oslo metropolitan area, include residential and office burglaries and petty thefts. Pickpocketing and petty theft occur more frequently in major tourist areas, hotel lobbies, train and transit stations, and surrounding areas. The Oslo Central train station is an especially popular area for pickpockets and bag snatchers. Although rare, violent and weapons-related crimes do occur in areas known to have drug trafficking and gang problems, such as certain parts of eastern Oslo. As in any other urban area, you should remain aware of your surroundings at all times. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.

Svalbard: The Svalbard archipelago consists of nine main islands located midway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.  You need a passport to enter Svalbard. Unlike Norway’s mainland, Svalbard is not party to the Schengen Agreement and air travelers to Svalbard from Norway will depart the Schengen Zone prior to boarding. Travelers to Svalbard face unique hazards given the extreme weather conditions and limited transport infrastructure. The U.S. Embassy has no direct representation on Svalbard, limiting its ability to provide emergency consular services. Verify that you have adequate travel, medical, and medical evacuation insurance to cover the potential costs of medical treatment or repatriation before you travel to Svalbard. Although road systems exist within the three largest towns – Longyearbyen, Barentsburg, and Ny-Alesund – they do not connect with each other, making sea, snowmobile, or limited air service the only options for traveling throughout Svalbard. Tourism to Ny-Alesund is restricted due to its status as a research facility and the danger of polar bear attacks. There have been several reported instances of death or injury to tourists in the Svalbard archipelago due to animal attacks and boating incidents, often involving unpredictable weather or ocean conditions. In cases of illness or injury, a clinic in Longyearbyen can provide limited emergency care until medical evacuation to Tromsoe is available. You should consult the Svalbard Tourist Board for the latest travel conditions and information before you go. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States.  See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Child Protection Laws: The treatment of children is taken very seriously in Norway. All forms of corporal punishment of children are against the law, and any form of violence, humiliating treatment, or neglect may result in the child being taken away from parents by the Norwegian authorities and placed into long-term care by Norway’s social services.

Oslo Gardermoen International Airport is accessible to wheelchair users and the staff is very helpful with accessibility issues. The Oslo subway/light-rail system (T-banen) has above-average wheelchair accessibility. Taxi drivers are generally helpful in assisting wheelchair users.  It is possible to order taxis with wheelchair lifts. From December to March it is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to navigate Oslo’s streets without assistance due to snow and ice. Shopping malls, hotels, public buildings, and most modern structures will have accessible toilets. Fewer than half of the restaurants in Norway are wheelchair accessible and many have restrooms located up or down a flight of stairs. Many modern public structures, such as shopping centers, substitute inclined moving walkways/ramps for elevators, which are difficult for wheelchair users to use safely. Norway’s Tourist Board website offers accessibility information specifically for ferries. Students :  See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips .

Oman,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. MARAD Report: According to the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD), U.S. flag vessels in the Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and the Bab el Mandeb regions face an elevated risk of attacks by violent extremists. U.S. flag vessels should report suspicious activity to: COMUSNAVCENT battle watch captain at 011-973-1785-3879 U.S. Coast Guard National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802 (toll-free), 202-267-2675, or 202-267-4477 (TDD).

For additional information please see Oman’s Penal Code and our Human Rights Report for Oman . Dial 1100 to reach the government-operated domestic violence hotline. Tourism : The tourism industry is generally well-regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage, and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","COVID-19 Testing: For general PCR testing and exiting Oman, various health clinics in Oman offer PCR tests with results within 72 hours as well as 24-hour and 3–6-hour options.  PCR tests are at the expense of the individual/traveler.  Prices vary by clinic and range from 20 – 40 OMR; surcharges often apply for expedited result processing within 24 hours or less.  Drive up testing, walk-in tests, and tests by appointment are all available in Oman.  Test result delivery varies by clinic: e-mail, text, and physical message are commonly used to communicate results. COVID-19 Vaccines: The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Oman. Please refer to the Omani Ministry of Health for additional information on vaccination registration. Visit the FDA's website to learn more about FDA-approved vaccines in the United States. For emergency services in Oman, dial 9999.  Emergency hotlines are mostly Arabic-speaking.  The U.S. Embassy has received reports from U.S. citizens who were unable to receive assistance due to language barriers. Response times for ambulance services vary.  Injured or seriously ill travelers should take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. Modern medical facilities and Western-style pharmacies are available. Local medical treatment varies from average to inadequate, depending on location. Hospital emergency treatment is available. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance overseas.  Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Government of Oman to ensure the medication is legal in Oman. Vaccinations : Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Omani authorities typically do not permit foreigners accused of crimes to leave the country while cases are open. See our webpage for further information. Carry your passport at all times, or you could be detained. It is illegal to photograph certain buildings. Alcohol and Drugs: You may be arrested for possession of alcohol or driving under the influence. Drinking is permitted in some international hotels, bars, homes, and some restaurants. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs include lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines.  Some prescription medications, such as narcotics, available in the United States may be illegal in Oman.  Travelers should check the Oman Ministry of Health’s Medications and Travel webpage before importing prescription medications. Motor Vehicle Violations: Traffic laws are strictly enforced and carry heavy penalties. Remote traffic cameras are extensively used to monitor speeding and stop light infractions. Immigration officials, airports and other ports of entry and exit have ready access to information on traffic offenses, and violators cannot depart Oman unless all fines have been paid in full. Personal Defamation Charges: Using vulgar language or hand gestures can lead to personal defamation charges. An accusation alone, regardless of who files it, can initiate a legal process. U.S. citizens can usually resolve these cases with a formal apology and payment of damages to the aggrieved party. Cultural Heritage Items: To avoid prosecution, check first with Omani authorities before taking “cultural heritage items” such as archaeological artifacts, meteorites, or stones. Notary Services: All foreign public documents (Birth, Marriage, Death, Divorce, academic records, etc.) need to be apostilled for use in Oman. The U.S. Embassy in Oman cannot apostille any documents issued in the U.S. See our website for designated authorities in the United States. That can issue an apostille. Employment in Oman: Although a common practice, it is illegal for Omani employers to retain your passport. Such retention could grant undue leverage to your employer in case of a dispute. U.S. passports are the property of the U.S. government. The U.S. Embassy cannot intervene in labor disputes. At the beginning of any employment, obtain a contract that clearly states the terms of employment. Try to resolve disputes privately with your employer. If this fails, consult our list of lawyers . Dress Code : Be sensitive to Islamic culture and do not wear sleeveless shirts, halter-tops, or shorts. Only wear athletic clothing in public when engaged in sports activities. Currency : U.S. bills printed before 2006 are often not accepted. Local currency is easily available from ATMs or currency exchange counters. Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: Consensual same-sex sexual conduct is illegal and subject to a jail term of six months to three years. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Oman prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, intellectual, or mental disabilities   Expect accessibility to be limited in older buildings (including government buildings and schools), public transportation, and general infrastructure, and more common in newer medical facilities and public buildings in cities. Outside of urban areas, access is greatly reduced.  Handicapped parking spaces are scarce. Omanis will generally try to accommodate reasonable requests for assistance.

Pakistan,"Terrorism: Violent extremist groups within Pakistan continue to seek opportunities to attack locations where U.S. citizens and other Westerners are known to congregate or visit, including: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Government facilities Schools and universities Shopping malls and markets Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by Westerners and tourists Public transportation hubs/stations Minority neighborhoods Outdoor recreation areas. Terrorists also target Pakistani officials, government facilities, security forces, and religious minorities. We recommend you limit the frequency of travel and minimize the duration of trips to public markets, restaurants, and other public locations. Attacks have included armed assaults on heavily guarded sites, including Pakistani military and police installations, and airports. Primary tactics of terrorists include suicide operations, shootings, and bombings (including vehicle-borne explosives and improvised explosive devices), while other actions include but are not limited to assassinations, carjackings, kidnappings, and assaults. The Government of Pakistan maintains heightened security measures, particularly in major cities, and these measures can vary from day to day. However, the U.S. government is aware of narcotics smuggled onto flights from Pakistan, which may indicate broader security vulnerabilities at Pakistani airports. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates regularly assess security situations and restrict the movements of official personnel as necessary.  Depending on ongoing security assessments, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates sometimes place areas such as tourist attractions, hotels, markets, shopping malls, and restaurants off-limits to U.S. government personnel under Chief of Mission (COM) security responsibility. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates prohibit personnel under COM security responsibility from using public transportation or taxi services. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates also prohibit such personnel from visiting houses of worship. Official U.S. government personnel visiting Pakistan are authorized to stay overnight in certain local hotels in Islamabad, and some other areas of the country.  Avoid hotels that do not apply stringent security measures. Depending on ongoing security assessments, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates sometimes place areas such as tourist attractions, hotels, markets, shopping malls, and restaurants off-limits to official U.S. government personnel on official travel/orders. Follow media coverage of local events and maintain good situational awareness and operational security wherever you travel in Pakistan. If you feel that your life is in danger in Pakistan, we advise you to report the threat to local police authorities and consider immediately changing locations or departing Pakistan. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: All travelers are advised to dress conservatively, with arms and legs covered, and to avoid walking alone. We recommend avoiding travel on the streets late at night. Urban crime can be organized or opportunistic and conducted by individuals or groups. It can include fraud, theft, robbery, carjacking, assault, and burglary. Incidents of crime and levels of violence are higher in low-income residential and congested commercial areas but are seen in wealthier areas as well. Pickpocketing, theft, and larceny are common on buses and trains at all hours of the day. Take precautions to avoid crime, including: Locking home and vehicle doors Varying routes and schedules Keeping bags or valuables under your legs away from passing vehicle traffic and ensuring that bag straps are not visible Traveling in groups Being accompanied by someone with the ability to speak the local language if you travel outside urban areas Carrying your mobile phone If you are assaulted, flee to a safe area and report the situation to local authorities by going directly to a police station or dialing 15 . Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to local, national, or international current events, including on politically significant holidays. Demonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Demonstrations, political rallies, or large religious gatherings intended to be peaceful can become confrontational and possibly escalate into violence. We advise U.S. citizens to avoid areas where large crowds of any kind gather. U.S Embassy and Consulate personnel are routinely instructed to avoid areas of any demonstration. During demonstrations or periods of civil unrest, the Pakistani government has in the past disabled cellular telephone and internet service, making it difficult for individuals to contact each other or the U.S. Embassy or Consulates. The U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulates General generally do not message or post information about routine demonstrations but will disseminate known information regarding demonstrations or unrest that pose a potentially specific threat to U.S. citizens, including U.S. government personnel in country. Celebratory gunfire may occur at any time but is most likely to occur during wedding celebrations, which are frequent from October to May, and on holidays such as New Year’s Eve. Although the likelihood of being struck is remote, falling rounds can cause injury or death. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 15 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(92)(51) 201-4000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. Police responsiveness varies widely, and crimes often go unsolved or unprosecuted. Dual U.S-Pakistani nationals may not be recognized as U.S. citizens by local authorities and may be treated as Pakistani nationals by the police and the courts.

We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or the Consulates in Karachi or Lahore for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not regularly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage","The Government of Pakistan requires travelers age 12 and over be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Pakistan reports Pakistan has endemic Wild Polio Virus. The government of Pakistan requires polio vaccination for some longer stays. Healthcare facilities and infrastructure is poor, especially outside major cities. Travelers are advised to have medevac insurance, to include repatriation of remains. Both medevacs and repatriations of remains for non-Pakistani citizens require Pakistani government permission. Basic medical care is available in major Pakistani cities but is limited in rural areas. Facilities in cities vary in quality and range of services and may be below U.S. standards; facilities in rural areas are consistently below U.S. standards. Medical facilities require pre-payment for services, and most do not accept credit cards. Effective emergency response to personal injury and illness is virtually non-existent in most of Pakistan. Ambulances are few, lack medical equipment, and are not necessarily staffed by medical personnel. If you are hospitalized, a friend or family member will be expected to attend to your basic needs. There is generally no nursing staff or equivalent. For this reason, it is recommended never to travel alone to Pakistan. Outside major cities, English is not spoken by most medical providers and hospitals. Pakistani hospital officials will typically not notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulates if a foreign citizen is hospitalized. Even if made aware of a medical situation, in some cases, a consular officer may not be able to visit due to travel restrictions. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals . However, we do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health webpage and general Traveler Advice for Pakistan .

A CDC Level 2 Travel Health Notice regarding global polio is in place. Review Travel Health Notice Polio . The following diseases are prevalent: Tuberculosis There is a risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other communicable diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV, in Pakistan. Travelers are urged to use the same cautionary and protective health measures they would in their own country. For emergency services in Pakistan, dial 15. The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Travelers to Pakistan should obtain supplemental insurance to cover possible medical evacuation and repatriation of remains. If you plan to engage in high-risk outdoor activities in Pakistan, it is essential that you engage the services of a travel risk and crisis management provider. Care providers in Pakistan do not accept insurance.  With the exception of State and military hospitals, providers will require payment before treatment. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pharmaceuticals: Visitors and foreign residents should bring sufficient supplies of prescription and commonly used over-the-counter medications. Many U.S.-brand medications are not available, there is a high incidence of fake pharmaceuticals, and the quality of locally produced medications is uneven. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Government of Pakistan to ensure the medication is legal in Pakistan. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Air Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. Air pollution is a significant environmental problem across Pakistan. Throughout the country, air quality varies considerably by city and fluctuates greatly depending on the season and local weather patterns. We encourage you to consult with your doctor prior to travel and consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. It is typically at its worst during the winter in Pakistan. Anyone who travels to areas where pollution levels are high is at risk. People at the greatest risk from pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens; People over 65 years of age; People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema; People with heart disease; and People who work or are active outdoors. Air quality data for major cities in Pakistan can be found on the U.S. Embassy’s website . Water Quality Throughout Pakistan, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Sanitation in most restaurants is inadequate. Diarrheal illnesses are common. Travelers to Pakistan are at risk for other infectious diseases as well. More information about these illnesses and how to protect against them can be found on the CDC webpage for Pakistan Adventure Travel: Pakistan’s mountains and glaciers make it a tempting destination for adventure enthusiasts. Despite the best efforts of local authorities, assisting visitors lost or injured in such remote areas can be difficult. In recent years, several U.S. citizens, including expert climbers, have lost their lives while climbing in the Karakoram mountain range, where rescue missions are often difficult or impossible to execute. Costs for emergency rescues start at $15,000, and payment is required prior to commencement of a search operation. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel . Altitude: Some areas in Pakistan, especially K2 (Mount Godwin-Austen) in the Karakorum mountain range in the Gilgit-Baltistan region, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness, and take precautions before you travel. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Travel to High Altitudes .","Criminal Penalties: U.S. citizens are subject to the local laws of the foreign countries they visit or reside in. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. The U.S. government does not intervene with local authorities or advocate for particular outcomes on behalf of private individuals in legal matters. Furthermore, certain acts of U.S. citizens overseas are prosecutable as crimes in the United States even if they are not illegal under the local laws. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings or structures, particularly sensitive places like military installations, cantonments, and nuclear sites, but the law on this subject is vague and applied inconsistently. It is illegal to import alcohol into Pakistan without prior coordination with the government and even then, it is permissible only under very specific circumstances. Travelers entering Pakistan with alcohol face potentially severe penalties. Additionally, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs could result in imprisonment and other severe penalties. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs in Pakistan are severe, and those convicted can expect lengthy imprisonment, heavy fines, and possible capital punishment. Exit controls, or bans on departing the country, are frequently used as a condition of bail. Civil Matters : The Embassy often receives reports of property disputes and cannot become involved in civil matters. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Pakistani law enforcement authorities will typically not notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulates if a foreign citizen is arrested or detained, unless you request they do so. Pakistan’s regulations governing the travel of foreign diplomats and the procedures for gaining access to arrested individuals have delayed consular access in the past. In some cases, a consular officer may not be able to visit due to security-related travel restrictions. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, and they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up the counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website and the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports International Volunteers: Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: Same-sex sexual conduct is a criminal offense in Pakistan. While the government rarely prosecutes cases, society generally shuns LGBTQI+ persons, and violence and discrimination against LGBTQI+ persons occur frequently. The penalty for same-sex relations is a fine, imprisonment (sentences ranging from two years to life imprisonment), or both. No laws protect against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics, and LGBTQI+ persons rarely reveal their sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: Even in major cities, accessibility for persons with physical disabilities is difficult.  Pakistani law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is unevenly enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Do not expect public transportation, lodging, communication/information, or general infrastructure in Pakistan to have the same accessibility standards found in the United States. The availability of rental, repair, and replacement parts for equipment and devices is limited, especially outside major population areas. Services for persons with disabilities may also be limited outside the largest cities. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General often receive reports of U.S. citizens subjected to domestic violence, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, and forced marriage in Pakistan. There are also cases of individuals having their own and their children’s passports confiscated by spouses, parents, or other family members and having their freedom of movement severely restricted. Local police are not consistently responsive to reports of such cases. Nonetheless, if you find yourself in a life-threatening situation, you are encouraged to call the police immediately and follow up with a call to the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. We can sometimes connect you with a Pakistani non-governmental organization that may be able to provide assistance. If you are victimized overseas, you may be entitled to receive compensation for counseling and/or other services such as relocation back to the United States.

Curfew: Koror State, where most tourist facilities are located, may enforce a curfew between 2:30 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., Monday through Thursday, and between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m., Friday to Sunday, and on national holidays. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries and they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website and U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Vaping is banned: In April 2023 Palau passed a law banning the import, advertising, sale, and use of e-cigarettes. Individuals caught violating the law could face a $1,000 fine, and businesses or persons importing, distributing and/or selling the product could face a $20,000 fine. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTQI+ events in Palau. Palau’s constitution defines marriage as between a man and a woman. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Palau prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public isas prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include access to services, but accessible facilities vary. Palau’s overall accessibility for the disabled is very limited. While many buildings have ramps to facilitate persons with disabilities, others do not. There is no public transportation equipped to transport persons on wheelchairs and sidewalks around Palau are limited. There is no legislation in place that mandates access to transportation, communication, and public buildings for persons with disabilities. The only existing legislation is access to government buildings, which requires that there be at least one designated parking space close to the main entrance of each national government building open to the public. These parking spaces shall be clearly designated through use of words or symbols, as being available for use only by persons with disabilities.

Panama,"The Mosquito Gulf and the Darien Region are particularly dangerous due to their remoteness and the presence of criminal organizations. In the Darien region, most travel is by river or by footpath due to the scarcity of roads. There are reports of narco-traffickers, and other smugglers and criminals operating in the Panama-Colombia border area. Access to the “Mosquito Gulf” region is almost exclusively by boat and/or aircraft. Sections of this coastline are reportedly used for narco-trafficking and other illicit activities. Demonstrations: There are often demonstrations to protest internal Panamanian issues or, more rarely, manifestations of anti-American sentiment. Some demonstrations may result in blocked roadways or major highways including in locations popular with U.S. citizens. Panamanian National Police will generally not use force against peaceful demonstrations or roadblocks. While most demonstrations are non-violent, the Panamanian National Police have used tear gas and/or riot control munitions in response to demonstrations, particularly when roadways are blocked or aggression is used against the police. Beach and Maritime Safety: Many of Panama’s beaches on both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts are subject to large waves and dangerous currents. Conditions can change rapidly and drowning deaths occur. Few beaches feature lifeguards. Boaters should be wary of vessels that may be transporting narcotics, other illicit materials, or might be involved in human smuggling operations. Packages containing narcotics have been found floating in the ocean or lying on remote beaches. Do not pick up or move these packages. Immediately report their location to the Panamanian authorities. Local maritime search and rescue capabilities are limited. If you are experiencing an emergency at sea or know of someone who is experiencing an emergency off the coast of Panama, please contact the Panamanian authorities. Crime: Panama City, Colon, and Chiriqui province have the highest crime rates. Crimes include shootings, home invasions, rapes, armed robberies, muggings, and thefts. You should take the same precautions you would take in other big cities. Remove valuables from your car. Keep windows up and doors locked while driving. Use only licensed and registered taxis. Avoid taxis with passengers and instruct the driver not to pick up additional fares while en-route to your destination. Regular taxis are yellow in color. Many hotels also have “tourist taxis” that are not yellow but only pick up passengers in front of well-known hotels. Taxis in Panama do not use meters so agree on a fare before getting into the taxi. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing 104 (National Police) or 511-9260 (Tourist Police in Panama City) and contact the U.S. Embassy at +507-317-5000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes that occur in Panama. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide a list of local attorneys Provide information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States Put you in touch with the Panamanian Office of Assistance to Victims of Crime (Oficina de Asistencia a Víctimas de Crímenes), located at the Technical Judicial Police Station (Policia Tecnica Judicial) in the Ancon area of Panama City, which can be reached at 512-2222. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical Support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. If you are in immediate danger, first contact the local police at 104. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is often only available in or near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities, which limits their ability to provide urgent medical treatment in those areas. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .","Panama City is known to have some good hospitals and clinics, but medical facilities outside of the capital are limited. Hospitals in Panama are either private hospitals or government-run public hospitals. Private hospitals typically require payment of the anticipated costs of hospitalization prior to providing services and require payment of any additional costs upon release from the hospital. These costs can be in excess of USD$10,000-$20,000, depending on the nature of the treatment. In Panama, most hospitals accept credit cards for hospital charges, but not for doctors' fees and do not accept international wire transfers or credit card payments over the phone. Except for antibiotics and narcotics, most medications are available without a prescription. The 911-call center provides ambulance service in Panama City, Colon, and the Pan-American Highway between Panama City and Chiriqui. However, an ambulance may not always be available and given difficulties with traffic and poor road conditions, there may be a significant delay in response. There are private ambulance services available on a subscription basis. The U.S. Embassy does not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid do not apply overseas. Medical Insurance : Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. The following diseases are prevalent: Zika virus Dengue Chikungunya Malaria Travelers’ Diarrhea Tuberculosis Vaccinations : Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further health information : World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some offenses are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. See our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. If you break local laws in Panama, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution, and the Embassy cannot get you out of jail or prison.  Keep in mind, if you are arrested for an offense, tried and convicted, you must be sentenced before you can be transferred to the United States to complete your sentence in the United States. This process can last three or more years. Carry Identification: Anyone not bearing identification may be held and will be penalized by the Panamanian authorities. You should always carry your passport that contains the Panama entry stamp in case it is requested by Panamanian authorities. Drugs: Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Panama are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Property: Exercise extreme diligence in purchasing real estate in Panama. The U.S. Embassy in Panama has received numerous property dispute complaints. The complaints include lost property, broken contracts, and demands for additional payments, accusations of fraud and corruption, and occasionally threats of violence. More information can be found here . Customs Restrictions: Panamanian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning importation into or export from Panama of items such as firearms and ammunition, cultural property, endangered wildlife species, narcotics, biological material, and food products. Contact the Panamanian Embassy for specific information regarding customs requirements. Do not buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available as you may also be breaking local law. The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Division in the U.S. Department of Justice has more information on this serious problem. For further information about customs regulations, please read our Customs Information page . See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Faith-Based Travelers: See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report . LGBTI Travelers: Same sex marriages are not conducted nor recognized in Panama. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals enjoy full legal rights in Panama. However, Panamanian law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, and there is societal discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance. Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what you find in the United States. Panamanian law only mandates access to new or remodeled public buildings for persons with disabilities, which is being enforced for new construction. Handicapped parking is often available at many larger parking lots. Students: See our Students Abroad page. Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Papua New Guinea,"Summary: Crime is a significant concern. U.S. citizens have been victims of violent crime, including sexual assault, carjacking, home invasions, kidnappings, and armed robberies. Tensions between communal or clan groups may result in violent conflict at any time, including in Port Moresby and other urban areas. Exercise a high degree of caution in remote areas, as law enforcement presence is extremely limited and tourist and transportation facilities are inadequate. Unexploded ordinance and mines may be found in Bougainville, East New Britain, and throughout the Papua New Guinea islands. Exercise caution when walking or hiking off marked roads and trails. There has been a recent uptick in small-scale piracy, particularly in waters surrounding Madang and Milne Bay. Crime: Papua New Guinea has a high crime rate. Crime rates are highest in and around major cities such as Port Moresby, Lae, Madang, Mount Hagen, and Goroka, but crimes can occur anywhere. You are at a greater risk of violent crime such as sexual assault if you travel alone, especially if you plan to hike in isolated rural areas. Pickpockets and bag-snatchers frequent crowded public areas, including parks, golf courses, beaches, and cemeteries. Bag-snatchers may try to open doors of automobiles that are stopped or moving slowly in traffic. Please see our page on Personal Safety . Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes and law enforcement-related emergencies to local police by calling 112. In the event you are unable to get through to the police, operators with St. John Ambulance Service may be able to assist you by passing your request to the police control center. You may also contact the U.S. Embassy at +675 308 2100. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance . Organized Tours and Adventure Travel Organized tours booked through travel agencies remain the safest means to visit Papua New Guinea, although on rare occasions, even persons participating in organized tours have been subject to violent crime and injury. If you choose to travel to Papua New Guinea with a group tour, here are some things to be aware of: Excursions to local shops, restaurants, and tourist sights should be done in groups. Security protocols, standards of professionalism, and pricing can vary widely among tour operators and local guides. Unscrupulous tour guides or criminal elements may attempt to extort money from tour groups and individual travelers through the use of informal roadblocks, unwarranted delays, or by imposing additional undisclosed fees. Before making tour arrangements, research tour operators and guides, and compare itineraries through multiple sources, including the Papua New Guinea Tourism Promotion Authority. Diving and Snorkeling: Scuba divers and or snorkelers are advised to check the references, licenses, and equipment of tour operators before agreeing to a tour. Confirm the dive operator is certified through one of the international diving associations, and that their certification is current. Confirm with the diving association directly that the operator is certified. Local dive masters may not consider your skill level when they organize a trip. Rent equipment only from trustworthy operators and be sure to receive training before using the equipment. Some rental diving equipment may not be properly maintained or inspected. Make sure that your travel medical insurance covers your sport. The Divers Alert Network (DAN) website has information on diver’s insurance. Deaths and serious accidents have occurred in the past because basic safety precautions were not taken during diving and snorkeling trips. Remember that safety measures and emergency responses may not meet U.S. standards. Papua New Guinea has one hyperbaric recompression chamber to provide medical assistance for dive-related injuries, located in Port Moresby at the Tropicair Hangar at Jacksons International Airport. However, it may not always be operational. Diving injuries may therefore require medical evacuation to Australia. Many popular dive sites are located near outlying islands, and it may take several hours to reach facilities in the event of an accident. Other Water Sports: Exercise caution and common sense when engaging in all adventure sports, including but not limited to whitewater rafting, sea kayaking, and windsailing. Make sure your travel medical insurance covers your sport. Never participate in adventure sports alone. Before kayaking, rafting, or windsailing, check water conditions and wear a life jacket and helmet. Water conditions may become extremely dangerous during heavy rainfall, and flash floods are common. Hiking: Exercise caution if you plan to hike the Kokoda Track, the Black Cat Track, Mt. Wilhelm, Mt. Giluwe, or other established or informal hiking trails in Papua New Guinea. Hikers have been attacked and killed, even along the most well-known routes. Local landowners occasionally threaten to close parts of the tracks due to local land and compensation disputes. Carry a first aid kit and observe all local and trail-specific regulations. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel . Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.","For emergency services in Papua New Guinea, dial 111 to reach St. John Ambulance Service. Ambulance services are: Not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except for Port Moresby and other major urban areas. Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Not always staffed with trained paramedics and/ or may have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation, as severe injuries often require medical evacuation to Australia, Singapore, the Philippines, or the United States at a cost of thousands of dollars. Medical evacuations to Australia require a visa or Electronic Travel Authority . Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Embassy of Papua New Guinea to ensure the medication is legal in Papua New Guinea. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Health facilities in general: Health facilities are available in Port Moresby and other major urban areas, but health care may be below U.S. standards or vary greatly between locations. Public medical clinics often lack basic resources and supplies. Hospitals and doctors may require payment “up front” prior to service or admission, and credit card payment is not always available. Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient. Generally, in public hospitals, only minimal staff is available overnight. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are extremely limited, even in Port Moresby and other urban areas. Hospital-based care is only available through one government institution in Port Moresby. Pharmaceuticals: Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Persons arriving in Papua New Guinea are advised to travel with copies of any prescriptions for medication. Common prescription and over-the-counter medications are generally available at pharmacies located in major urban areas. Water Quality: In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. General Health: The following diseases are prevalent: Chikungunya Cholera Dengue HIV Japanese Encephalitis Leptospirosis Malaria Measles Polio Rickettsioses Sexually Transmitted Diseases Traveler’s Diarrhea Tuberculosis Zika Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays. HIV/AIDS: Please see the CDC website regarding HIV Basics . Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in Papua New Guinea.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from relevant local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: Same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is a conservative country and public displays of affection are generally not understood or welcomed. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance . Papua New Guinea does not have legislation mandating access to transportation, communication, and public buildings for persons with disabilities. The road network in Papua New Guinea is in poor condition. Foot paths, road crossings, and stairways in most major towns are congested, uneven, and are generally not constructed or maintained with an eye toward access for persons with disabilities. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Papua New Guinea prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, or mental disabilities, but is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure in both rural and urban areas, including the capital. The availability of rental, repair and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices, or service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants is limited. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: Sexual assault and gender-based violence are relatively common in Papua New Guinea. Though most often reported in urban centers and against the local population, these attacks can occur anywhere and also be directed against tourists or foreign residents. Police have limited capacity to respond to such crimes and health workers at local medical facilities may not be adequately trained or have the capacity to provide victim-centered care or administer post exposure prophylaxes. Women are advised of the following precautions: Do not travel alone, and if possible travel with a group of people you trust. Avoid public transport, especially after dark. Limit evening entertainment to venues with professional security. Avoid isolated areas when alone at any time of day. Respect local dress and customs. Customary everyday dress for women throughout the country is conservative, and even more so in non-urban areas, with women wearing clothing that covers their shoulders and their legs past the knees. Ask if your lodging has a female-only floor or section. Some hotels in Papua New Guinea offer this option. See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Special Circumstances: Customs: Papua New Guinean customs authorities enforce strict regulations governing firearms, certain prescription drugs, wooden artifacts, animal products, food, and sexually explicit material. Firearms should not be brought into the country. Other products may be subject to quarantine. You should contact the Embassy of Papua New Guinea in Washington, D.C. for specific information regarding customs requirements. Natural Disasters: Papua New Guinea is among the most disaster-prone countries in the world. Earthquakes, tropical cyclones, destructive tsunamis, exceptionally high tides, seasonal and flash flooding, and landslides can occur with little or no notice. The country has many active volcanoes. Recent eruptions have occurred in in Bougainville, East and West New Britain, and Manam Island. Ash from volcanoes in East and West New Britain occasionally disrupts air and ground operations at the airports in Kokopo and Hoskins. Documentation: Carry a copy of your U.S. passport and Papua New Guinean visa at all times so that you can demonstrate your proof of identity, U.S. citizenship, and immigration status to authorities if asked."
Paraguay,"Security Messages: Messages regarding demonstrations, strikes, and weather-related events are posted on the Embassy’s website . Terrorism: The U.S. Embassy is not aware of any specific threat to U.S. citizens in Paraguay. Nevertheless, you should remain vigilant at all times while travelling. Crime: Transnational criminal organizations facilitate the illicit trafficking of arms, narcotics, and other goods in Paraguay, particularly along Paraguay’s eastern border with Brazil, most prominently from Pedro Juan Caballero south to Ciudad del Este, including the Tri-Border Area of Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina. Coupled with the lack of sufficient police enforcement, the involvement of these organizations heightens violent crime in these areas. The U.S. Embassy in Asuncion requires U.S. government personnel and their family members to provide advance notice and a travel itinerary when traveling outside of the capital, particularly when traveling to Ciudad del Este, or to the departments of Alto Parana, San Pedro, Concepcion, Amambay, and Canindeyu. U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Paraguay should also avoid large gatherings or events where crowds have congregated to demonstrate, protest, or cause damage as a byproduct of celebrating an event, such as after soccer matches. Street crime is prevalent in the cities and the number of pickpockets and armed assaults is increasing. Robbers are more regularly using motorcycles to approach victims with a weapon and demand a wallet or purse, before quickly fleeing. Thieves have been known to pose as service people (e.g., mailmen, reporters, water meter readers, electrical repairmen, delivery persons, maintenance personnel) to gain access to homes. They sometimes wear uniforms and travel in vans and automobiles with markings that make the vehicle appear official. Do not let such people inside your home unless you have contacted the service provider directly to verify the appointment. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the U.S. Embassy. Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+595) 021-213-715 and press 2210 (Dial (+595) (21) 229 581 after hours).

Peru,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) U.S. Embassy Lima enforces a Restricted Travel Policy for Embassy personnel, which is based on its assessment of conditions and developments throughout the country. See the Overseas Security and Advisory Council’s Country Security Report for Peru. See the latest Travel Advisory for Peru . The VRAEM (Valley of the Apurímac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers) is particularly remote and a known safe haven for narcotraffickers and the last operational remnants of the Shining Path terrorist group. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime : Crime is a widespread problem in Peru. Sexual assaults and rapes can occur, even in tourist areas. Travel in groups, do not leave food or drinks unattended, and use caution if a stranger offers you food or drink. Intoxicated travelers, including U.S. citizens, also have been sexually assaulted, injured, or robbed while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Pick-pocketing, robbery, and hotel room theft are the most common crimes. Armed robberies have occurred throughout the city, including popular tourist destinations. Armed assailants usually target victims for their smartphones, wallets, or purses. If confronted by someone with a weapon, it is best not to resist. Incapacitating drugs, such as rohypnol and scopolamine, have been used to facilitate robberies and sexual assaults. Seek medical attention if you begin to feel ill. On routes to and from the airport in Lima, robberies have occurred where the assailant uses a tool to break a window while the vehicle is stopped in traffic.  Keep your belongings in the trunk or out of sight. Authorized taxi booths are present at the airport in Lima that will charge a flat rate according to the destination. Use hotel safes, if available. Avoid wearing obviously expensive jewelry or clothing, and carry only the cash or credit cards that you need. Stay alert in crowds and on public transportation. Be aware that thieves might create distractions to target you. Avoid isolated areas when on foot, especially after dark. Be alert for robberies in which criminals enter a taxi and force victims to withdraw money from ATMs. Use an app-based taxi service, order a taxi by phone, or use a service affiliated with a major hotel, as it is usually safer than hailing an unknown taxi on the street. Use ATMs in well-protected indoor areas such as banks or shopping malls. Avoid withdrawing large amounts of cash at one time. Do not let your credit card out of your sight in order to avoid credit card “skimming.” You should expect the vendor to use a credit card reader in your presence. The vendor will ask for your passport or ID number on the receipt. To avoid carjacking or theft from your car while you are stopped at intersections, drive with your doors locked and windows rolled up. Do not leave valuables in plain view. There is little government presence in many remote areas of the Andes and Amazon basin. Illicit activities, such as illegal mining, logging, and coca production, are common. Drug trafficking and other criminal activity, combined with poor infrastructure, limit the capability and effectiveness of Peruvian law enforcement in these areas. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens along the Colombian border and in the VRAEM, as U.S. government personnel are restricted from traveling in these regions.

Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. U.S. citizens are encouraged to pay attention to waiver and liability policies of tour companies, as they may vary or not exist. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","COVID-19 Testing: PCR and/or antigen tests are available for U.S. citizens in Peru, and test results are reliably available within one calendar day. Peru is able to test for COVID-19 in country. Private hospitals and laboratories as well as the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MINSA) are administering tests. U.S. citizens are responsible for their own COVID-19 testing costs. COVID-19 Vaccines: The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Peru. Visit the FDA's website to learn more about FDA-approved vaccines in the United States. Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Sinopharm vaccines are available in Peru.

However, some medications might not be offered, and brand names will differ from products in the United States. Exercise caution if you explore herbal and folk remedies. For emergency services in Peru, dial 113 . Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Lima and other major cities. Training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. We do not pay medical bills . Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance : Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Government of Peru to ensure the medication is legal in Peru. Vaccinations : Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further health information : World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Air Quality : Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Health Facilities in General: Adequate health facilities are available in Lima and other major cities, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies. Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is usually available. Some hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment. Private and public hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient. Travelers should make efforts to obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care. Medical staff may speak little or no English. Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals if they do not have insurance. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery : U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery. Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Peru. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Peru. Although Peru has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Peru, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified. Pharmaceuticals: Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Please review Peru's rules on medication . Non-Traditional Medicine: U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners in Peru. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities in such cases. Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy : If you are considering traveling to Peru to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology, please see our ART and Surrogacy Abroad page . Surrogacy is illegal for foreigners in Peru, subject to complex local regulation. If you decide to pursue parenthood in Peru via assisted reproductive technology (ART) with a gestational mother, be prepared for long and unexpected delays in documenting your child’s citizenship. Be aware that individuals who attempt to circumvent local law risk criminal prosecution. Water Quality: In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Altitude: Many cities in Peru, such as Puno, Cusco, Arequipa, Ayacucho, and Huaraz, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness, and take precautions before you travel. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Travel to High Altitudes . Adventure Travel: Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel . General Health : The following diseases are prevalent: Dengue Travelers’ Diarrhea Guillain-Barré Syndrome Hepatitis A and B Leishmaniasis Malaria Rabies Tuberculosis Yellow fever Zika Typhoid Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays. HIV/AIDS: For more information visit MINSA’s website (in Spanish): https://www.dge.gob.pe/vih/ . Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in Peru. Air Quality: Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Peru. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons but is typically poor year-round. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teen. People over 65 years of age. People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. People with heart disease or diabetes. People who work or are active outdoors.","Criminal Penalties : You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. Ayahuasca/Kambo/Hallucinogens: Traditional hallucinogens, often referred to as ayahuasca or kambo, are often marketed to travelers as “ceremonies” or “spiritual cleansing,” and typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong hallucinogen that is illegal in the United States and many other countries. Intoxicated travelers, including U.S. citizens, have been sexually assaulted, injured, or robbed while under the influence of these substances. Health risks associated with ayahuasca are not well understood, and, on occasion, U.S. citizens have suffered serious illness or death after taking these drugs. These incidents often occur in remote areas and far away from modern medical facilities, making the risks even greater. Drugs : Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Peru are severe. Offenders can expect long pre-trial detention and lengthy prison sentences under harsh conditions with significant expense for themselves and/or their families. Never agree to carry a suitcase or package through customs for anyone. Peru uses strict screening procedures for detecting narcotics smuggling at its international airports. Customs Currency Regulations : $30,000 USD or its equivalent in cash or negotiable items is the maximum allowed for entry or exit. Any amount in excess of $10,000 USD must be declared and the legal source proven. Artifacts : Peruvian law forbids the export of pre-Columbian objects and other artifacts protected by cultural patrimony statutes. U.S. customs officials are required to seize pre-Columbian objects and certain colonial religious artwork brought into the United States. Animal Products/Plants : Avoid products made of wild plants and animals, as many are of illegal origin and may involve protected or endangered species, whose sale and export are illegal. Peruvian authorities will seize any protected species that is sold or transported, either live or transformed into food, medicinal beverages, leather, handcrafts, garments, etc. Some products, including live animals, require special permits when leaving Peru. Knowingly importing into the United States wildlife or plants that were taken from the wild or sold in violation of the laws of Peru (or any other country) is a violation of the Lacey Act (16 USC § 3371). Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Special Circumstances : Many popular destinations in Peru are remote. These areas have few facilities that are able to provide advanced or emergency medical care. Local rescue capabilities are severely limited. Many mountain areas are too high for helicopters to reach safely. Accidents or injuries while hiking or climbing are common; crisis responders may take hours or even days to reach you if they are traveling over great distances and/or rough terrain. When using tourist company services, travelers are encouraged to use qualified and licensed operators. Many do not meet international safety standards. Inquire about safety standards prior to engaging in adventure activities. The Ministerio de Comercio Exterior y Turismo (Tourism Ministry) website provides information on tourism companies. Always check with local authorities before traveling about local geographic, climatic, health, and security conditions that may impact your safety. Be aware that you may not have access to phone or internet for days at a time. Check in with family prior to going to remote areas and leave detailed written plans and timetables. Use of a personal GPS beacon is encouraged. Seismic Activity :  Earthquakes are common throughout Peru. On May 26, 2019, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck the Loreto region of Peru. One fatality in the Cajamarca region and 11 injuries as well as isolated power outages and some infrastructure damage were reported. Visit Peru’s National Emergency Operations Center (COEN) for more information. In the event of a natural disaster, monitor local media and government agencies, including IPeru , the Commission to Promote Peru for Exports and Tourism (PROMPERU) , and Peru’s National Meteorology and Hydrology Service (SENAMHI) for updates.

Legal Issues in Peru : The legal system in Peru may require victims or their families to hire lawyers to advance their cases through the legal system, even for victims of serious crimes. U.S. citizens have reported unethical practices by lawyers and others, resulting in costly losses and little hope of remedy through the local judicial system. Peruvian laws are subject to change with little notice . The Peruvian government publishes little information in English. The U.S. Embassy cannot give detailed advice about Peruvian law. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods : Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Faith-Based Travelers : See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports LGBTQI+ Travelers : There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTI events in Peru. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: Peruvian law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities, and the law is enforced.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include ramps, special cashiers for those with disabilities, and elevators. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, and common in lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. There is a significant difference between Lima (and other large cities) and the rest of the country. Rental, repair, and replacement services are available for aids/equipment/devices. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a list of translators . Students : See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers : See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Philippines,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less-sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) U.S. citizens should remain alert to the potential for explosions and bombings as part of pre-planned attacks, as well as the threat of kidnapping. Terrorist and armed groups continue plotting possible kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks in the Philippines. Terrorist and armed groups may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. For more information, please visit our website here . Crime: Confidence games (con games), pickpocketing, Internet scams, and credit/ATM card fraud are common. Be wary of unknown individuals who attempt to befriend you, especially just after you arrive in country. Do not accept food, drinks, or rides in private vehicles from strangers, even if they appear to be legitimate. Solo travelers have been drugged and robbed by strangers after accepting an invitation to visit a tourist destination. Kidnappings, physical assaults, murder-for-hire, and other violent crimes occur in the Philippines. Philippine government law enforcement agencies are engaged in a nationwide counter-narcotics campaign that has resulted in a sharp increase in violence between police and individuals suspected of involvement in the drug trade. As part of this campaign, law enforcement is engaged in aggressive search and buy-bust operations that could affect foreigners. Taxis or ride-sharing applications are the recommended form of public transportation. However, taxi drivers and/or individuals using stolen taxi cabs have committed robberies. Ask the hotel, restaurant, and/or business establishment to call a reliable taxi service for you. Do not enter a taxi if it has already accepted another passenger. Request that the taxi driver use the meter to record your fare. Wait for another cab if the driver is unwilling to comply with these requests. Make a mental note of the license plate number of your taxi, or text it to someone, should there be a problem. When driving in the city, make certain that vehicle doors are locked and windows are rolled up. Travelers have been stopped and robbed shortly after leaving Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport in a taxi or private vehicle. One common form of credit/ATM card fraud involves an illicit electronic device attached to ATM card readers that retrieves and records information, including the PIN, from a card's magnetic strip. Refer to the Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) website for more information . International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in the Philippines. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters.

Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: Please check with the Philippine Department of Tourism before traveling. The safety standards you might expect of transport and tour operators, including adventure activities such as diving, are not always met. Sufficient safety equipment may not be provided, and recommended maintenance standards and safety precautions may not be observed. Always use available safety equipment, such as lifejackets or seatbelts, even if others do not. If appropriate safety equipment is not available, use another provider. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance . If you are planning to dive, the Diver’s Alert Network (DAN) provides information on diving accident management.","For emergency services in the Philippines, dial 911.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. The judicial process in the Philippines typically is lengthy, extending for years rather than weeks or months, and individuals charged with a crime can be held in indefinite pre-trial detention as their case makes its way through the judicial system. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in the Philippines are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. If a traveler is found to have any amount of drugs on his or her person, or nearby, when arriving or departing from the Philippines, he or she will be charged with trafficking. Trafficking is a non-bailable charge, and the maximum penalty is life imprisonment. If you intend to enter the Philippines with a prescribed controlled substance (e.g., medical marijuana), obtain clearance from the Philippine government first. Since June 2016, Philippine authorities have conducted a public campaign against illegal drugs. This has resulted in armed confrontations between authorities and suspected drug dealers and users. Always carry a copy of your passport in the event that you are asked about your citizenship. You may be questioned by authorities if you take pictures of certain buildings, especially government buildings or military installations. Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs could land you immediately in jail. The Philippine Bureau of Immigration (BI) may consider the participation of foreigners in demonstrations or political rallies in the Philippines to be a violation of the terms of admission. Foreign nationals who participate in demonstrations, political rallies, or other activity deemed anti-government in nature may be detained and deported for violating Philippine immigration laws. In the Philippines, any adult in the company of a minor under 12 years old who is not related within the “fourth degree” may be subject to a severe penalty. U.S. citizens should be aware of this law both to avoid unlawful behavior and to protect themselves against potentially frivolous accusations. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.

Transgender travelers should be aware that immigration officials may require supporting documents if the gender in the traveler’s passport does not reflect the gender expression of a transgender person. According to Philippine law, an individual’s sex must match that assigned at birth as reflected on the official birth certificate, even in cases of post-operative sex reassignment. Same-sex relationships are not illegal in the Philippines, but they lack legal recognition. No federal law prohibits discrimination against LGBTQI+ individuals. Several cities, however, have passed local ordinances protecting LGBTQI+ rights. Despite these legislative efforts, LGBTQI+ individuals continue to face discrimination and harassment. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights Report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: Streets, buildings, and public transportation may lack facilities for persons with disabilities. Most public buildings are inaccessible to persons with physical disabilities or mobility impairments.  Government efforts to improve access to transportation for persons with disabilities are limited due to weak implementing regulations. There are local stores in the Philippines for durable medical equipment (DME) and some pharmacies also carry limited medical supplies and equipment.

Poland,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: While Poland has a low crime rate overall, the risk of crime is higher in major cities. Safeguard your belongings in public areas . Thieves and pickpockets operate at major tourist destinations, railroad stations, and on trains (particularly overnight trains), trams, and buses. Report incidents of theft to the police. Do not leave valuables in plain sight inside vehicles . If someone directs you to pull over or signals that something is wrong with your car, continue driving until you reach a safe spot (such as a crowded gas station, supermarket, or a police station) to inspect your vehicle. Only change money at banks or legitimate exchange kiosks (kantor). ATMs at commercial banks, large hotels, shopping malls, and airports are safest. While casinos and gaming establishments are government-regulated, some are affiliated with or have attracted the interest of organized crime. Avoid adult entertainment venues . Such establishments have been known to present foreign customers with inflated charges and threaten those who refuse to pay. There have been some incidents of suspected drink spiking associated with these venues. Travel in a group when going out at night to nightclubs, discos, bars, or high-tourism areas, such as the Market Square in Krakow and Old Town in Warsaw. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Poland. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Most scammers pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Tips to avoid scammers: Look for red flags like their location is far away, their profile was recently created or seems to be too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or they ask for money. Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages. Do a reverse image search on the profile picture. If they ask for help, you should refer them to the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate so we can work with local authorities to assist. If you believe you have been scammed, report the incident to local law enforcement right away and stop all communications with the scammer. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting (kidnapping, arrested, medical emergency) Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Technology Usage Abroad: Mobiles Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. GPS navigation apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using a GPS app, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety considerations. Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

While medication and treatment are generally substantially less costly than in the United States, doctors and hospitals often expect cash payment prior to treatment . Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Medication, while generally available, may not be U.S. brand-name drugs. For emergency services in Poland, dial 112 . Ambulance services are widely available.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned, or deported. A U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask the police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulate immediately . Under Polish law, a person with Polish and U.S. citizenship is deemed to be a Polish citizen; however, dual U.S.-Polish nationals may still ask to see a U.S. consular officer. See our webpage for further information. Special Circumstances: Polish Law prohibits possession of firearms or ammunition without proper permits. In Poland, it is illegal to possess, carry, transport, import or export arms or ammunition without proper authorization. Polish law broadly defines the meaning of “arms” to include items that may put life or health at risk, which may include parts of firearms or ammunition. Travelers have been arrested who were in possession of military items without proper permits. Please visit the Government of Poland’s website to find out more about obtaining a permit and our website on traveling with firearms .

Polish law prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity and the government enforces these provisions. The social acceptance of LGBTQI+ individuals is not as prevalent as in the United States, though polling indicates tolerance is steadily increasing. Some politicians have made derogatory comments about LGBTQI+ persons. Media have not recently reported on physical and verbal attacks against LGBTQI+ persons, but community members have reported concerns about their physical safety. Travelers identifying openly as LGBTQI+ may face harassment. The practice of so-called conversion therapy is legal and offered on a voluntary basis. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section six of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities : Polish law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but some discrimination occurs. Polish law states that buildings should be accessible for persons with disabilities, but in practice, many buildings remain inaccessible. Newer public trains, vehicles, and stations may be accessible, but older ones are not. Wheelchair users will find many challenges throughout the country. Service animals are generally allowed in public buildings and on transportation. Pedestrian crossings at intersections in large cities are generally equipped with audible crossing signals.

Portugal,"Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible near-term attacks in Europe. All European countries, including Portugal, remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant with regard to their personal security. Crime: Crimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, particularly at popular tourist sites, restaurants, and on public transportation, are common. Pickpockets take advantage of crowds getting on and off all forms of public transportation, such as the popular Tram 28, using the jostling of the crowd as a distraction. Avoid standing near the doors on public transportation, as thieves will often strike just as the train/bus doors open and then dash onto the platform and disappear into the crowd. Safeguard your passport and identity documents when traveling throughout Portugal. Foreigners who arrive in Portugal without a valid passport will not be permitted to enter and will be returned to their point of origin. Be aware of your surroundings and take personal security measures to stay safe. Thefts of backpacks, electronics and luggage occur regularly. Do not leave valuables in rental cars, especially those with stickers identifying the vehicle as a rental car. Tourists are frequent victims of petty crime/car break-ins.

Always use a taxi from the queue or kiosk. Do not go with someone who walks up to you and offers a ride. If you have called a ride sharing service such as Uber, confirm that the car information in the App matches the vehicle you are entering. Tourists should not leave personal items or valuables unattended while at the beach. Reports of thefts from rental homes and online rental apartments have increased.  Secure belongings and lock windows while away or sleeping. Demonstrations occur in Portugal.

Republic of the Congo,"Political violence and civil unrest may occur. In the past, political demonstrations have led to armed clashes, deaths, and injuries. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. Official travel outside Brazzaville must be approved by the Embassy on a case-by-case basis. The Republic of Congo’s borders remain porous, particularly with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic; cross-border crime and armed activity may occur. National Parks and Wildlife Areas : Heed all instructions given by guides or trackers. Armed poachers are present in some parks and forested border regions. Ensure you have the proper medical and medevac insurance for safari/adventure tours. Roadblocks : Armed soldiers or national police may conduct vehicle searches and check passengers for identity papers. These roadblocks often are poorly marked, and local authorities may target foreigners to solicit bribes. Crime : While not common, violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, and assault, remains a concern throughout the Republic of the Congo. Opportunistic crime, such as petty theft, pickpocketing, mugging, vehicle theft, and burglary, are frequently reported. Most crimes affecting expatriates in Brazzaville involve financially motivated opportunistic theft, robbery, and/or burglary, sometimes involving the use of bladed weapons. Risk of crime increases at night and in remote or isolated areas. Violent crime exists in outlying southern and northern neighborhoods of Brazzaville due to armed gang activity. Demonstrations occur, though they have been on a small-scale in recent years.

In Samoa, driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Behavior modification facilities: There is one overseas treatment center or Behavior Modification Facility operating in Samoa. Although this facility may be operated and staffed by U.S. citizens, the Samoan government is solely responsible for its compliance with local safety, health, sanitation, and educational laws and regulations, including all licensing requirements of the staff in country. These standards may not be strictly enforced or meet the standards of similar facilities in the United States. Parents should be aware that U.S. citizens and non-citizen nationals 16 years of age and older have a right to apply for a U.S. passport and to request repatriation assistance from the U.S. government, both without parental consent. Any U.S. citizen or non-citizen U.S. national has the right to contact a representative from the U.S. Embassy. Parents may also contact the U.S. Embassy in Apia or the Office of American Citizens Services, Bureau of Consular Affairs. Stray dogs: In Apia, and in many villages, stray dogs wander the streets. You should not approach or feed them; they can become aggressive in the presence of food or if they feel threatened. There have been several cases of attacks by multiple dogs. Please exercise appropriate caution when you are walking, running, or riding a bike near stray dogs. Ferry service: Although there have been no major accidents involving the ferry service linking Upolu and Savaii, vessels are sometimes overloaded. One of the ferries, a multi-deck, automobile ferry, sometimes transports passengers on its automobile deck. To avoid injury from shifting vehicles, you should ride only in the passenger compartment, not on the automobile deck during the crossing. Blowholes: Samoa has numerous “blowholes” (lava tubes open to the sea where wave action produces often spectacular geysers). These blowholes are popular tourist attractions. The footing around the mouths of most blowholes is very slippery. To avoid being swept in, you should not approach too closely and should never stand between the opening of the blowhole and the sea. Financial transactions: Some businesses in Apia, especially those frequented by tourists, do accept credit cards, but many do not, including gas stations. Major hotels and some restaurants and stores accept major credit cards (Visa, Master Card, and American Express). You can get Samoan currency from ATMs, which are located in Faleolo Airport, Salelologa, and many locations in Apia. For more information on ATM locations and banking services, visit the ANZ Bank website or the BSP website. Disaster preparedness: Samoa is located in an area of high seismic activity called the “Ring of Fire” and is subject to earthquakes which can trigger a tsunami. The rainy (or monsoon) season in the South Pacific is from November to April, when strong winds, heavy rains, landslides, and disruptions to services could occur. For information about tropical cyclone preparedness, visit our Crisis and Disaster Preparedness webpages, and NOAA's Hurricane Preparedness Guide. For information about all types of natural disasters, visit the CDC webpages . Customs: Samoan customs authorities may enforce strict regulations about importing or exporting items such as firearms, fruits, pets and other animals, and drugs. You should contact the Samoan Mission to the United Nations at 800 2nd Avenue, Suite 400J, New York, NY 10017, telephone: (212) 599-6196 for specific information regarding customs requirements. You can also consult the Samoa Ministry of Revenue website . Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: Same-sex acts are a crime in Samoa, with prison terms of up to seven years. The Crimes Ordinance 1961 and the more recent Crimes Act 2013, which came into effect in May 2013, criminalize same-sex acts. There is no recognition of same-sex relationships, marriage or adoption by same-sex couples in Samoa. There are also no anti-discrimination laws in place. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance. While in Samoa, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from in the United States . There is no law pertaining specifically to the status of disabled persons. Most major hotels, restaurants, and cafes are actively restructuring their facilities to accommodate persons with disabilities. However, disabled travelers should clarify with the hotel what accommodations are available before they book. Persons with disabilities have easy access to medical facilities. Some family-based beach accommodations in the outer villages are also working to provide accessibility for disabled persons. Many of the new multi-story buildings provide ramps and elevators, but older public buildings do not. The blind and persons in wheelchairs or on crutches will have difficulty navigating in and around Apia because of a limited number of stoplights and sidewalks. Traffic is particularly hazardous for the disabled in rural areas that have no footpaths and sidewalks. Most buses and taxis do not have ramps to accommodate wheelchairs.

San Marino,"Several major earthquake fault lines cross Italy. Principal Italian cities, with the exception of Naples, do not lie near these faults; however, smaller tourist towns, such as Assisi, do lie near faults and have experienced earthquakes. An earthquake severely damaged the town of L’Aquila in 2009. General information about disaster preparedness is available online from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Detailed information on Italy's fault lines is available from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Italy also has several active volcanoes generating geothermal events. Mt. Etna, on the eastern tip of the island of Sicily, has been intermittently erupting since 2000. Mt. Vesuvius, located near Naples, is currently capped and not active. Activity at Mt. Vesuvius is monitored by an active seismic network and sensor system, and no recent seismic activity has been recorded. Two of Italy's smaller islands, Stromboli and Vulcano, in the Aeolian Islands north of Sicily, also have active volcanoes with lava flows. Detailed information on volcano activity in Italy is available from the USGS. Politically motivated violence in Italy is most often connected to Italian internal developments or social issues. Italian authorities and foreign diplomatic facilities have found bombs outside public buildings, received bomb threats, and have been subjects of letter bombs in the past several years. Organized crime and anarchist movements sometimes use firebombs or Molotov cocktails against buildings or offices. These attacks generally occur at night, and although they have not targeted or injured U.S. citizens, you should remain aware of your surroundings and report any suspicious activity to local authorities. Demonstrations may have an anti-U.S. character, especially in areas hosting U.S. military bases. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful have the potential to turn confrontational and possibly escalate into violence. You should take common sense precautions and follow news reports carefully. Stay up to date by reading the Embassy’s Demonstration Notices . Italian authorities have made several high-profile arrests involving members or affiliates of transnational terror groups. Like other countries in the Schengen area, Italy’s open borders with its Western European neighbors allow for the possibility of terrorist groups entering/exiting the country with anonymity.

Take some time before travel to consider your personal security. Here are some useful tips for traveling safely abroad : CRIME: Italy has a moderate rate of crime. You should exercise extra caution at night and at train stations, airports, nightclubs, bars, and outdoor cafes. If you are drinking heavily, your ability to judge situations and make decisions may be impaired, making you a target for crime. Young drinkers are particularly vulnerable to robbery and physical and sexual assault. Petty crimes such as pick-pocketing, theft from parked cars, and purse snatching are serious problems, especially in large cities. Pick-pockets sometimes dress like businessmen. You should not be lulled into a false sense of security by believing that well-dressed individuals are not potential pick-pockets or thieves. Most reported thefts occur at crowded tourist sites, on public buses and trains, and at the major railway stations: Rome's Termini; Milan's Centrale; Florence's Santa Maria Novella; and Naples's Centrale at Piazza Garibaldi. For more information on trains and security, please see the Italian railway police’s advice for travelers . You should also be alert to theft in Milan’s Malpensa Airport, particularly at car rental agencies. Clients of Internet cafes in major cities are also targeted. Be careful with your bag or purse, as thieves on motor scooters are very quick and can snatch a purse off of your arm from a moving scooter. Resisting these thieves can be hazardous, as some tourists have suffered broken arms and collarbones. Thieves in Italy often work in groups or pairs. Pairs of accomplices or groups of children are known to divert tourists' attention so that another can pick-pocket them. In one particular routine, one thief drops or spills something on the victim; a second thief assists the victim in cleaning up the mess; and the third discreetly takes the victim's belongings. Criminals on crowded public transportation slit the bottoms of purses or bags with a razor blade or sharp knife removing the contents. Some travelers in Rome, Florence, and Naples have reported incidents where criminals used drugs to assault or rob them. These incidents have been reported near Rome’s Termini train station; at bars and cafes near Rome’s Colosseum, Colle Oppio, Campo de Fiori, and Piazza Navona; and at bars and cafes in the center of Florence and Naples. Criminals using this tactic “befriend” you at a train station, restaurant, café, or bar, and then offer you a drink laced with a sleeping drug. When you fall asleep, criminals steal your valuables and may sexually assault you. Some victims of these assaults in Rome have required hospitalization and two cases resulted in death. Thieves are also known to have impersonated police officers in order to steal. The thief shows you a circular plastic sign with the words ""police"" or “international police"" and then in perfect English asks to see your identification and your money. U.S. citizens should be aware that local police will generally exit their own vehicle when speaking with members of the public. Also, plainclothes undercover units rarely attempt to pull over vehicles without a marked car accompanying them. If this happens to you, you should insist on seeing the officer's identification card (documento) before handing over your wallet as impersonators tend not to carry forged documents. You should immediately report thefts or other crimes to the actual police. Be alert to the possibility of carjackings and thefts while you are waiting in traffic or stopped at traffic lights. This has been a particular problem in Catania, Sicily. Use particular caution driving at night on highways, when thieves are more likely to strike. U.S. citizens have reported break-ins of their rental cars during stops at highway service areas; thieves smash car windows and steal everything inside. Theft of small items such as radios, luggage, cameras, briefcases, and even cigarettes from parked cars is prevalent. Vehicles parked near beaches during the summer can be broken into and robbed of valuables. Lock car doors whenever you park, and do not leave packages in your car in plain view. The U.S. Secret Service in Rome is assisting Italian law enforcement authorities in investigating an increase in the appearance of ATM skimming devices. These devices are attached to legitimate bank ATMs, usually located in tourist areas, and capture the account information stored electronically on the card’s magnetic strip. The devices consist of a card reader installed over the legitimate reader and a pin-hole video camera mounted above the keypad that records the customer’s PIN. ATMs with skimming devices installed may also allow normal transactions to occur. The victim’s information is sold, traded on-line, or encoded on another card, such as a hotel key card, to access the compromised account. Here are some helpful hints to protect against and identify skimming devices: Use ATMs located in well-lighted public areas, or secured inside a bank/business; Cover the keypad with one hand as you enter your PIN; Look for gaps, tampered appearance, or other irregularities between the metal faceplate of the ATM and the card reader; Avoid card readers that are not flush with the face of the ATM; and Closely monitor your account statements for unauthorized transactions. Organized criminal groups operate throughout Italy, but are more prevalent in the south. They occasionally resort to violence to intimidate or to settle disputes. Though the activities of such groups are not generally targeted at tourists, visitors should be aware that innocent bystanders could be injured. Don’t buy counterfeit or pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are the bootlegs illegal to bring back into the United States, if you purchase them, you may also be breaking local law. According to Italian law, anyone caught buying counterfeit goods (for example, DVDs, CDs, watches, purses, bags, belts, sunglasses, etc.) is subject to a fine of no less than EUR 1,000. Police in major Italian cities enforce this law to varying degrees. You are advised to purchase products only from stores and other licensed retailers to avoid unknowingly buying counterfeit and illegal merchandise. VICTIMS OF CRIME: If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime abroad, you should contact the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. We can: Replace a stolen passport; Help you find appropriate medical care in instances of violent crimes such as assault or rape; Put you in contact with the appropriate police authorities and, if you want us to, we can contact family members or friends; and Help you understand the local criminal justice process and can direct you to local attorneys, although the local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Italy is 113. Please see our information on victims of crime , including possible victim compensation programs in the United States. Please see also information regarding assistance for victims of crime in Italy . CRIMINAL PENALTIES: While you are traveling in Italy, you are subject to its laws even if you are a U.S. citizen. Foreign laws and legal systems can be vastly different than our own, and criminal penalties vary from country to country. There are also some things that might be legal in Italy, but still illegal in the United States; For instance, you can be prosecuted under U.S. law if you buy pirated goods. Engaging in sexual conduct with children or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is a crime prosecutable in the United States . Arrest notifications in host country: You should try to remain aware of local laws and their implications. If you break local laws in Italy, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. If you are arrested in Italy, Italian authorities are required to notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate of your arrest. To ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances, request that the police and prison officials notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate as soon as you are arrested or detained overseas.","Medical facilities are available, but may be limited outside urban areas. Public hospitals, though generally free of charge for emergency services, sometimes do not maintain the same standards as hospitals in the United States, so you are encouraged to obtain insurance that would cover a stay in a private Italian hospital or clinic. It is almost impossible to obtain an itemized hospital bill from public hospitals, as required by many U.S. insurance companies, because the Italian National Health Service charges one inclusive rate for care services and room and board. In parts of southern Italy, the lack of adequate trash disposal and incineration sites has led to periodic accumulations of garbage in urban and rural areas. In some cases, residents have burned garbage, resulting in toxic emissions that can aggravate respiratory problems. The U.S. Navy initiated a public health evaluation in the Naples area in 2008. After finding levels of bacterial and chemical contamination of potential health concern, particularly in samples of area well water, the Navy recommended all personnel living off-base in the Naples area use only bottled water for drinking, cooking, ice-making, and brushing teeth. For more information on safe food and water precautions, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website . You can find good information on vaccinations and other health precautions on the CDC website . For information about outbreaks of infectious diseases abroad, consult the World Health Organization (WHO) website , which also contains additional health information for travelers, including detailed country-specific health information .","Strikes and other work stoppages occur frequently in the transportation sector (national airlines, airports, trains, and bus lines); most are announced in advance and are of short duration. Reconfirmation of domestic and international flight reservations is highly recommended. You must obey local transportation laws and regulations. You must purchase train tickets and validate them by inserting them into validating machines, which are usually located near the entrance of train tracks, prior to boarding. Failure to follow this procedure may result in an on-the-spot fine by an inspector on the train. You must purchase bus tickets prior to boarding and validate them immediately after boarding. Tickets may be purchased at tobacco stores or kiosks. Failure to follow this procedure may result in an immediate fine imposed by an inspector on the bus. If the violator does not pay the fine on the spot, it will automatically double and will be forwarded to the violator’s home address. You must obey local driving laws and regulations. Vehicle traffic in some historic downtown areas of cities and towns throughout Italy is limited by a system of permits (called “ZTL,” functioning the same way as an electronic toll system in the United States might on the freeway). Cameras record the license plates of cars driving in parts of the city that require a permit. Although most of the automated verification stations are clearly marked, if a driver passes one, it is impossible to know at the time that a violation occurred or has been recorded. Violators are not pulled over or stopped, and there is no personal contact with a police officer. Whenever possible, the fines imposed for these violations are forwarded to the driver’s home in the United States to request payment. Notice from Italian authorities of a violation may take a year or longer to arrive. The fines are cumulative for each time a driver passes a control point. A similar system of automated traffic control cameras is in place in many parts of the highway system and is used to ticket speeding violations. Accessibility: While in Italy, travelers with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation different from what is found in the United States. Many find Italy’s narrow cobbled streets and storied monuments charming; they can, however, be a challenge for physically impaired travelers. Many Italian sidewalks lack ramps, some Italian streets lack sidewalks altogether, or for instance in the case of Venice, may feature staircases and narrow pedestrian bridges. While some major sights and hotels have put time and planning into ensuring accessibility, there are others that lack ramps, elevators, or handicap-accessible bathrooms. Advance planning can go a long way in making a difference in accommodation for disabled travelers. Inform airlines and hotels of your disabilities when making reservations as some time may be needed to prepare accommodation. Call ahead to restaurants, museums, and other facilities to find out if they are wheelchair-accessible. Most, but not all, train stations in Italy have accommodations for those traveling in wheelchairs. With advance notice, personal assistance can be provided to a disabled person traveling through a particular station. More information is available at Trenitalia's website addressing disabled travelers . For those who wish to rent cars, hand-controlled vehicles are available in Italy from major car-rental companies. You should contact the car rental company well in advance of your trip in order to reserve the vehicle. Remember that Italy functions on 220 volt current. To recharge an electric wheelchair motor, you may require a transformer to change the 220 current to 110 volts, as well as an adapter to adjust the plug to fit Italian electrical sockets. Guide-dog owners must present the documentation required by European Union Member States in order to enter Italy with a dog"

Saudi Arabia,"The Department of State advises you to exercise increased caution when traveling to Saudi Arabia due to terrorism and the threat of missile and drone attacks on civilian targets. See the Travel Advisory for Saudi Arabia here . Do not travel: Within 50 miles of the border with Yemen due to terrorism and armed conflict. Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Saudi Arabia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Terrorists have targeted both Saudi and Western government interests, mosques and other religious sites (both Sunni and Shia), and places frequented by U.S. citizens and other Westerners. Houthis operating in Yemen have fired long-range missiles into Saudi Arabia, specifically targeting populated areas and civilian infrastructure; they have publicly stated their intent to continue doing so. Missile attacks have targeted major cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah, Riyadh’s international airport, Saudi Aramco facilities, and vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes. Rebel groups are also in possession of unmanned aerial systems (UASs or drones) which they have used to target civilian infrastructure and military facilities in Saudi Arabia. U.S. citizens living and working on or near such installations, particularly in areas near the border with Yemen, are at heightened risk of missile and drone attack. On October 11, 2018 the Saudi General Authority for Civil Aviation issued a Notice to Airmen about threats to civil aviation and airports in Saudi Arabia posed by missiles and UASs launched from Yemen. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the U.S. Government’s Defense Internet NOTAM Service (Type “OEJD” in the search field, then click “View NOTAMs,” then scroll down to W0438/18 and click to view). The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the following locations as U.S. government personnel and their families are restricted from travel to: Within 50 miles of the Saudi-Yemen border, including the cities of Jizan and Najran; Qatif in the Eastern province and its suburbs, including Awamiyah. You can find additional details relating to safety and security in our Travel Advisory and Alerts and the website of the U.S. Mission in Saudi Arabia . Crime: Crime in Saudi Arabia has increased over recent years but remains at levels far below most major metropolitan areas in the United States. You should be aware of your surroundings, keep valuables out of sight and secure, and travel with a companion, if possible. Some Saudi citizens who perceive that a foreigner is not observing conservative standards of conduct or dress have been known to harass, pursue, or assault that person. Even when released from detention, witnesses to criminal incidents may be prohibited from leaving the country until investigation of the incident is complete. See the websites of the Department of State and the FBI for information on scams. Victims of Crime: If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime, you should contact the local police at “999” and contact the Embassy in Riyadh or one of the Consulates in Jeddah or Dhahran.Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. See the Department of State’s webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .

Domestic Violence: If you are the victim of any form of physical violence, including domestic violence, you should contact the Saudi police by calling “999”.  In addition, victims of domestic violence can contact the Saudi National Domestic Violence Hotline by dialing “1919.” The Saudi Ministry of Labor and Social Development runs a network of shelters for women and children. Contacting the domestic violence hotline (“1919”) is the only way to access these shelters. The Saudi National Family Safety Program also runs a Child Help Line “116111” and can assist children in accessing Saudi social services. When reporting domestic violence, it is imperative to get a case reference number as all Saudi social and legal assistance is tied to this case number. It is also a good idea to document any injuries and obtain a copy of any medical reports. U.S. citizens should be advised that filing a police report or utilizing any Saudi victims’ assistance services may result in the Saudi authorities informing your sponsor or guardian. U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or Consulates for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.

Saudi law requires Saudi citizens to obtain official permission from the government before obtaining a second nationality. At times, Saudi authorities have confiscated the passports of U.S. citizens applying for Saudi citizenship. This does not constitute loss of U.S. citizenship. If this happens to you or someone you know, report the incident to the U.S. Embassy. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or consulate immediately. Be aware that Saudi Arabia generally restricts consular notification of the arrest of foreigners to the Embassy of the country that issued the travel document used to enter the Kingdom. If you enter Saudi Arabia with a Saudi travel document, or with the passport of a country other than the United States, it will be extremely difficult for the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services if you are subsequently detained. Persons detained in Saudi Arabia may be held without charges for lengthy periods and denied access to counsel; dual citizens may not have consular assistance. See the Embassy’s webpage for further information. Drones: The importation of drones for commercial or personal use is prohibited without prior approval from the General Authority for Civil Aviation (GACA). A customs clearance certificate authorizing importation can be obtained as part of the GACA approval process. Visit GACA’s website for further information. Criminal Penalties: While in Saudi Arabia, you are subject to local laws. If you violate Saudi laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled; arrested; imprisoned; held without trial for lengthy periods of time; interrogated without counsel; subject to corporal punishments, including lashings; or executed. Penalties for the import, manufacture, possession, and consumption of alcohol or illegal drugs in Saudi Arabia are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences, heavy fines, public floggings, and deportation. The penalty for drug trafficking is death. Furthermore, some laws are prosecutable in the United States regardless of local law. For examples, see our webpage on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website . There are substantial limitations on freedom of speech and political expression in Saudi Arabia. For additional information see the Department of State’s Human Rights Report for Saudi Arabia . Faith-Related Travel Issues: Islam is the official religion of the country and is present in all aspects of life in Saudi Arabia. See our Hajj and Umrah Fact Sheet . Saudi authorities do not permit criticism of Islam or Muslim religious figures, including on social media. The government prohibits the public practice of religions other than Islam. Non-Muslims suspected of violating these restrictions have been jailed and/or deported. Church services in private homes have been raided, and participants have been jailed and/or deported. Muslims who do not adhere to the strict interpretation of Islam prevalent in much of Saudi Arabia may encounter societal discrimination and constraints on public worship. Public display of non-Islamic religious articles, such as crosses and Bibles, is not permitted. Non-Muslims are forbidden to travel to Mecca and parts of Medina, the cities where two of Islam’s holiest mosques are located. See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report . LGBTI Travelers: Same-sex sexual relations, even when consensual, are criminalized in Saudi Arabia. Violations of Saudi laws governing perceived expressions of, or support for, same-sex sexual relations, including on social media, may be subject to severe punishment. Potential penalties include fines, jail time, or death. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of the Department of State's Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what is generally found in the United States. Saudi law does not prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities, and there is no legislation requiring public accessibility. Newer commercial and government buildings, however, often include such access. According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Development, there are numerous government-sponsored centers for people with disabilities. Note that Saudi Arabia has limited infrastructure to care for those with mental disabilities. Students: See the Department’s Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Residents and Travelers: Married women, including non-Saudis, require their husband's permission to depart the country, while unmarried women and children require the permission of their father or male guardian. Minor children must have their father’s permission in order to leave the Kingdom. Children visiting their fathers in Saudi Arabia, even when there is a custody agreement, can be prevented from leaving unless the father consents. This is true even if the child is an American citizen. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates cannot obtain exit visas for the departure of minor children without their father/guardian's permission. If a foreigner and a Saudi living in Saudi Arabia divorce, Saudi courts rarely grant permission for the foreign parent to leave the country with the children born during the marriage, even if he or she has been granted physical custody. Foreign mothers of Saudi children, who are divorced or widowed, may apply for a permanent residency permit(iqama) without the need for a sponsor. To do so, they must prove maternity and that they were legally married to the Saudi father. Also see the Department’s travel tips for Women Travelers . Employment: The Arabic text of a contract governs employment and business arrangements under Saudi law. Verbal assurances or side letters are not binding under Saudi law. In the event of any contract dispute, Saudi authorities refer to the written contract. Sponsors have wide latitude and responsibilities for employees and family members under their sponsorship, including obtaining residence permits for the employee and for any family members. All residents should be issued a Saudi residence permit (iqama) and are legally required to carry it at all times. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General in Saudi Arabia cannot sponsor private U.S. citizens for Saudi visas. Sponsors have been known to demand that residents working in Saudi Arabia surrender their passports while in the Kingdom. Such practices are illegal and should be reported to the Ministry of Labor and Social Development . Since the Saudi sponsor controls the issuance of exit permits, U.S. citizens may be prevented by the sponsor from leaving Saudi Arabia in the event of a labor or business dispute, which could take months or years to resolve. To change employers within the Kingdom, Saudi Arabia requires the written permission of the original sponsoring employer. The U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulates General cannot assist in labor or business disputes, nor can they provide translation or legal services. U.S. consular officers can provide lists of local attorneys to help U.S. citizens settle business disputes, but ultimate responsibility for the resolution of disputes through the Saudi legal system, and payment for those services, lies with the parties involved. For additional information on Saudi labor law, please refer to the Ministry of Labor and Social Development’s webpage . Customs: Saudi customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning the importation of such banned items as alcohol, weapons, and any item that is held to be contrary to the tenets of Islam (such as pork, anything considered pornographic under strict Islamic principles, and religious materials). Imported and domestic audiovisual media and reading matter are censored. Christmas and other holiday decorations, fashion magazines, and ""suggestive"" videos may be confiscated and the owner subject to penalties and fines. Electronic devices may be subject to inspection upon entry or exit. Please see the Department’s Customs Information page as well as the Saudi Customs webpage. Importing Animals: The Saudi Ministry of Agriculture must approve all pets imported into Saudi Arabia. Cats and dogs entering Saudi Arabia require a Veterinary Health Certificate and a dated letter from the veterinary practitioner addressed to his/her sponsor to obtain the necessary approval from the Ministry of Agriculture. Both documents must be authenticated by the Department of Agriculture Veterinary Service Office and the State Department's Authentications Office and attested by the Embassy of Saudi Arabia . The certificate must indicate that the animal was examined and is free from disease and confirm that rabies and other vaccines are current. Information on the name, breed, sex, color, and age of the animal must also be stated. Please see additional information on taking a pet overseas . Teaching English in Saudi Arabia: In recent years, increasing numbers of American language teachers have experienced contractual and other problems. Some teachers have complained about arbitrary dismissals, difficult living conditions, salary arrears, unwanted reassignments, restrictions on their movement, and inability to leave the country. Prospective teachers in Saudi Arabia should vet their potential employer and carefully review their employment offer as well as the detailed information found in the Embassy’s Guide to Teaching English in Saudi Arabia . Additionally, prospective teachers should also take care to make sure that they obtain the appropriate work visa prior to coming to Saudi Arabia. The Embassy cannot help you if you violate Saudi labor law. Standards of Conduct and Religious Police: Norms for public behavior in Saudi Arabia are extremely conservative. Both the uniformed police and the religious police, referred to colloquially as the mutawwa or al-hay’a, are charged with enforcing these standards. Mutawwa are required to carry special identification and usually are accompanied by uniformed police. While a 2016 government decree withdrew the authority of the mutawwa to make arrests independently of regular police forces, visitors should be prudent in their interactions with mutawwa. An individual must, if requested, present his/her residence permit (iqama) or other identification to the mutawwa or the police. U.S. citizens who are involved in an incident with the mutawwa should report the incident to the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh or the U.S. Consulates General in Jeddah or Dhahran. In most areas of Saudi Arabia, and particularly in Riyadh and the central part of the Kingdom, women wear a full-length covering known as an abaya. Most women in conservative areas also cover their hair with a hijab for modesty, and many also cover their faces with a niqab. Tourists are expected to dress modestly in public, avoiding tight fitting clothing or clothes with profane language or images; women are not required to wear abayas or cover their hair but are expected to cover their shoulders and knees, and men should not go without a shirt. Women who choose not to conform to Saudi Arabia’s dress code face a risk of confrontation by mutawwa, negative or hostile comments by Saudi citizens, and possible detention Guidelines on public decorum for tourists are available at the Saudi government’s official tourism website, www.visitsaudi.com. Many areas of life in Saudi Arabia are segregated by sex to ensure that unrelated men and women have no possibility of mingling (a punishable crime) by unmarried men and women. Less frequently, members of the mutawwa try to enforce this by asking for proof that a couple is married or related. Men and women detained for socializing with individuals who are not relatives may be charged with moral crimes such as khulwa (mixing with unrelated members of the opposite sex). Less frequently, some restaurants may refuse to serve women who are not accompanied by a close male relative In addition, a few restaurants or cafes do not have a ""family section"" in which women are permitted to eat. Men not accompanied by a close female family member are not allowed to enter family sections and cannot use services (such as registers at supermarkets) designated as “family.” These restrictions are not always clearly posted. While there are now movie theaters, musical concerts, and artistic performances in Saudi Arabia, the country remains socially conservative. Social media postings which contravene cultural standards can have legal and/or criminal consequences. Photography: The Saudi government does not permit photography of governmental facilities, such as military bases and government buildings, nor military, security, or police personnel. The Saudi government is also sensitive to photographs that may be perceived as portraying the country in an unfavorable light. This policy can include photos of mosques, impoverished areas, the local population, and traditional souks (markets). You should not take anyone’s picture without clear consent, and never take a picture of a woman or a place where women congregate. Be aware of local sensitivities whenever you are taking pictures in public. U.S. citizens have been routinely detained for violating these policies. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General are unable to intervene if you violate Saudi law. The Hajj and Umrah: Please review the Department of State’s Hajj and Umrah Fact Sheet for useful information on traveling to perform the Hajj or Umrah."
Senegal,"Visit the U.S. Embassy Dakar website for current messages to U.S. citizens regarding safety and security. Casamance region: There are sporadic reports of armed banditry in the Casamance region. Landmines from prior conflicts remain a concern, particularly in more remote parts off main roads. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the Casamance region. Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. While Senegal has not experienced any recent terrorist attacks, many places throughout West Africa, including Kayes Region of Mali on Senegal’s border, have witnessed such violence. More generally, terrorists increasingly have utilized less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds. Frequently, they seek out unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Crime: Street crime, including robberies at knife-point and home burglaries, is common in Senegal, particularly in urban areas. Beware of pickpockets, purse-snatchers, and thieves on motorized scooters. Robberies occur regularly along the Corniche d’Ouest, an area heavily frequented by tourists and westerners. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Senegal. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Common scams include: Romance/online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should contact the local police and the U.S. Embassy. Report crimes to the local police at 17 or to the Gendarmerie at 800-00-20-20 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(221) 33-879-4000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Explain the local criminal justice process in general terms Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Swimming: An increasing number of children drown each year in the Atlantic Ocean in Senegal. Riptides can occur anywhere on the coast. Do not swim in the ocean if you are inexperienced in swimming in water where very strong rip currents occur. Do not dive into water of unknown depths. Do not swim alone, especially at isolated beaches. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access and provide urgent medical treatment areas outside of major cities. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","Several hospitals and clinics in Dakar can treat major and minor injuries and illnesses; however, medical facilities outside Dakar are extremely limited and unprepared to handle major injuries. There is inadequate inpatient psychiatric care and limited office-based psychiatric treatment in Dakar. For emergency services in Senegal, dial 800-881-881 (Toll Free/Numero Vert) for SAMU. Ambulance services are either unavailable or unreliable in most areas except Dakar, where ambulance services exist but can often arrive with great delay (up to 30-45 minutes). In the event an ambulance is not immediately available (the services will often provide an estimated time of arrival), injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

Further health information : World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Water Quality: In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Wash raw vegetables and fruits in a bleach solution before eating. Air Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Senegal. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst during the Harmattan winds in January and February, which frequently carry dust and sand particles from the Sahara and result in poor air quality throughout the country. People at greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens People over 65 years of age People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema People with heart disease or diabetes People who work or are active outdoors","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.

Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad Special Circumstances: Senegal is generally a very tolerant society with excellent relations between the approximately 95 percent of the Senegalese population who practice Islam and the remaining five percent that practice Christianity and other religions. Senegalese culture is conservative, however, particularly in rural regions. Be mindful of local social and cultural mores pertaining to dress, displays of affection, and interactions between men and women. Personal Identification: Senegalese law requires all persons to carry valid personal identification at all times, and authorities may detain anyone, including U.S. citizens, who do not cooperate and provide identification. However, to minimize inconvenience in the event of theft, it is recommended that U.S. citizens carry copies, rather than originals, of their passports and other identification documents. Currency: Senegal’s currency is the franc of the Communauté Financière d'Afrique (fCFA), which has an exchange rate fixed to the Euro. Senegal’s economy operates primarily on a cash basis. Credit cards are not widely accepted. Although ATMs are available in some areas (primarily Dakar), they are not always reliable and should generally be avoided. Mobile money services, using local cell phone accounts, are becoming more common. You may be able to transfer money from the United States using a commercial wire-transfer company. LGBTI Travelers: Same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Senegal. LGBTI individuals routinely face discrimination. Under Article 319 of the Senegalese criminal code, “unnatural acts” are punishable by imprisonment of one to five years and a fine of fCFA 1,000,000 (USD $2,000). Several high-profile cases of arrest under these laws have occurred. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Senegal prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities but the law is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. The availability of rental, repair or replacement parts for aids, equipment, and devices for people with disabilities, including service providers such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants, is limited, especially outside of the capital city. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: Rape is a crime in Senegal punishable by up to 10 years in prison, though it is rarely prosecuted. Spousal rape is not criminalized. Domestic violence that causes lasting injury is punishable by up to twenty years in prison. Domestic violence that results in death is punishable by life in prison. However, the law against domestic violence is rarely enforced. Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is not specifically outlawed in Senegal and is commonly practiced in the south and southeast of the country. See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Serbia,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists worldwide are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, rudimentary Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, they target unprotected or vulnerable venues, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Anti-U.S. Sentiments: While Serbians can be welcoming to visitors, anti-U.S. sentiment is widespread and can be more prevalent around certain anniversaries and some national holidays, including: February 17 (anniversary of Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence), between March 24 and June 10 (the anniversary of the 1999 NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia in response to events in Kosovo), and potentially June 28 (St. Vitus’s Day or Vidovdan). Sporting Events: There is the potential for violence before, during, and after sporting events. There have been clashes between police and fans in the vicinity of sports venues, which are often located in residential areas.  The Embassy considers matches between certain teams, including Partizan, Rad, and Red Star, to be high risk events because of violence at previous games.  While U.S. citizens have not been targeted in the past, in a few isolated cases non-Serbians have been the victims of sports-related violence. U.S. Government employees are generally advised to avoid the vicinity of high-profile sporting events. Night Clubs: As a safety precaution due to xenophobic violence, the following clubs have been declared off-limits for U.S. Embassy personnel in Serbia: Plastic Klub Šlep (Shlep) Mr. Stefan Braun Crime: Violent crime in Serbia is most often associated with organized crime activities and hooliganism surrounding high-profile sporting events. Although not traditionally the targets of violent crime, tourists and visitors should maintain a heightened awareness of their surroundings, as in all major cities. Pickpocketing and financial crimes of opportunity are the most common occurrences. Tourists should pay attention to taxi meters and listed fares as some taxi drivers may try to scam foreigners and charge higher rates. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Maintain caution if within the vicinity of demonstrations. There is often a heavier than usual police presence near demonstrations and traffic may slow or stop until well after the demonstration ends. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime in Serbia, you should contact the local police. Report crimes first to the local police by dialing 192.

Serbia has active and increasingly-visible LGBTQI+ advocacy groups, and several LGBTQI+ bars operate openly and without problems in Belgrade. Many recent LGBTQI+ public eventshave been held without incident. However, LGBTQI+ travelers should exercise caution when visiting Serbia. Many LGBTQI+ persons in Serbia choose not to openly reveal their sexual orientation or show public displays of affection due to security and safety concerns, and many avoid reporting incidents to police. Similarly, many transgender and gender non-conforming persons often find themselves targets of discrimination and violence and therefore may make the choice to hide or modify their identities when in public spaces. Though a growing number of police officers have received training on how to work with LGBTQI+  individuals, including when they are victims of crime, many have limited experience and knowledge. For further general information on travel abroad by LGBTI individuals, please read our LGBTI Travel Information page. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Serbia prohibits discrimination against persons with  physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.

Slovakia,"Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Slovakia has seen an increase in the number of demonstrations in response to political events. Though still relatively rare, small, and so far peaceful, demonstrations and gatherings always have the potential to turn confrontational and escalate into violence. You should exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations. Please see the U.S. Embassy’s website for safety and security messages . Crime: while crime is relatively low, street crimes against tourists do occur in tourist areas. The most common crimes reported include pickpocketing and cell phone and bag/purse theft, particularly during the summer months. Most thefts reported by U.S. citizens occur at crowded tourist sites (such as Bratislava’s Old Town area) or on public buses, trams, or trains. Be alert to criminal schemes. Thieves, including adults and/or children, often work in groups or pairs. In many cases, an individual or group distracts the victim, sometimes with musical instruments or pets, so that others can pickpocket. Criminals target tourists at nightclubs with ties to organized crime. In the past, such establishments have presented foreign customers with inflated bills and threatened those who refuse to pay. They also spike drinks with disabling drugs and take the impaired victims to ATMs and coerce them to withdraw funds until they empty their accounts or the card is blocked. Domestic and foreign organized criminal organizations are well established in Slovakia. Though uncommon, violent incidents sometimes do occur. International Financial Scams : See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.

The following disease is prevalent: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) can result from the bites of ticks commonly found in the bushes and grass of forests in Slovakia at lower and middle elevations. They are most active from spring to late fall especially in the northern regions of Trencin and Zilina. Low risk exists throughout the rest of the country. Transmission occurs throughout the year, with highest activity from June through September. Even though the CDC does not explicitly recommend the TBE vaccine, other official European sources have recommended the TBE vaccine for travelers who plan to stay for extended periods or who plan to camp and stay outdoors. Vaccines are available through a general practitioner or a pediatrician in Slovakia but are not available in the U.S. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: LGBTI U.S. Citizens in same-sex marriages or civil unions who travel to or reside in Slovakia may face difficulties and legal issues, as the country does not recognize same-sex unions and adopted a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in 2014. Same-sex sexual activity between consenting adults is legal. Slovak law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and classifies crimes based on sexual orientation as hate crimes, though these laws are not always enforced. Prejudice and societal discrimination persist. LGBTI persons occasionally report that they receive anti-LGBTI verbal abuse in the form of slurs. However, Bratislava and Kosice have hosted annual Pride parades without major incident since 2010. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: Slovak law requires that public areas be accessible to persons with disabilities. Many older buildings and areas, however, have not been retrofitted.  Navigating most Slovak cities with a visual impairment or on a wheelchair is difficult due to the many obstacles and barriers on sidewalks and in public transport. Guide dogs are allowed in all municipal spaces, but may not be allowed in private shops, restaurants, and hotels; it is advised to call ahead to inquire.  See our Traveling with Disabilities page. Many sidewalks are narrow and uneven, and small towns may lack sidewalks. Some municipal spaces, such as post offices, hospitals, shopping centers, and libraries have either an elevator or platforms to accommodate customers who cannot use stairs.  Small restaurants and shops are less likely to be accessible. Traffic lights in some city centers have a sound signal for the visually-impaired, however, it is reported that they are often out-of-service.  Public signs for the visually-impaired are uncommon. The state television channels provide broadcasting for the hearing-impaired, and important national events frequently have visible sign language interpretation in real-time. Public transportation and the railway system stations generally lack elevators and do not provide easy access for people with mobility issues.  This is true even in the capital city of Bratislava. Only a few buses are equipped with lowering platforms, while trams have none. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Slovenia,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, rudimentary Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Slovenia’s overall crime rate is low. Incidents of purse snatching and pickpocketing are most common in tourist areas, with robberies and acts of vandalism reported in Ljubljana primarily late at night. Use common sense, avoid isolated areas after dark, take security precautions, and report any incidents to the local police. Residential break-ins occur, particularly in Ljubljana. Residences left unattended for extended periods with poor security measures are most vulnerable. Vehicle break-ins and thefts also occur. Always lock your vehicles, use vehicle anti-theft devices, and park in well-lit areas or in residential or hotel garages. Bicycle theft is disproportionately high compared to similarly situated cities. Ensure your bicycles are secured before leaving them in a bicycle rack or bike park. Exercise caution at so-called ""gentlemen's clubs."" Such establishments have presented foreign customers with inflated bar bills and threatened those who refuse to pay. U.S. citizens have reported sexual assaults in at least one nightclub in recent years. Use caution when accepting open drinks at bars or clubs, and don’t leave your drinks unattended. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Demonstrations: There are occasional strikes, protests, and other public demonstrations in Slovenia. Protests in Ljubljana are usually held in areas around Kongresni Trg (Congress Square), opposite the Slovenian Parliament, in other locations in central Ljubljana, and sometimes near the U.S. Embassy. Some participants have occasionally expressed anti-U.S. sentiments. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Be vigilant near crowded venues. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. For additional information, check the Embassy’s website. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police by dialing 113.

Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance . See our webpage for more information on insurance overseas. Outdoor adventure sports are increasingly popular with tourists in Slovenia. Such activities involve inherent risk, and travelers are encouraged to be mindful of their own personal limitations, as well as accessibility and connectivity issues that might hinder emergency response. Many of the mountain rescues in Slovenia involve foreign nationals who were ill-prepared: hiking or climbing without proper footwear and protective equipment, unprepared for altitude sickness, drinking insufficient water, leaving marked trails, and even handling poisonous snakes. If you are hiking/climbing you should let family/friends know in advance where you will be going and register at mountain huts. If you experience an emergency, call 112 for Slovenian police.","Facilities For emergency services in Slovenia dial 112. Ambulance services are widely available and reliable. When contacting an ambulance, if you do not speak Slovenian, you may need to find a Slovenian speaker who can explain your location. Medical care throughout Slovenia is comparable to that found in the United States.. Emergency responders may determine that patients requiring specialized and more complex medical care need to be transported to Ljubljana Clinical Center (public hospital) by air. While many medical providers in Slovenia speak excellent English, that may not be the case for all medical staff. There is a list of English-speaking medical providers and 24-hour pharmacies on the U.S. Embassy’s website . Although most government-run institutions in Slovenia provide care at little or no cost to Slovenian nationals, foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens, are expected to pay the full cost directly. That said, prices in government-run clinics are very reasonable. Private clinics are also an option. For both, you will pay up front and can later seek reimbursement from your health insurance provider. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.

Precautions for safe food storage and preparation are the same as would be practiced in the United States. Detailed laboratory reports about the water quality are available in Slovenian language. Slovenia does not put fluoride in the tap water, so long term residents might want to consider fluoride supplements for their children. General Health Language: Make sure you are up-to-date on routine vaccines before every trip. These vaccines include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, polio vaccine, and your yearly flu shot. Slovenia has a high incidence of Lyme disease and encephalitis, both transmitted by ticks. For stays longer than three months, consider getting a vaccine to prevent tick-borne encephalitis. This vaccine is not available in the United States, but is available in Slovenia. Use insect repellent and inspect your body after being outdoors.

Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different in Slovenia from what you find in the United States. Under Slovenian law, persons with disabilities should have access to buildings, information, and communications. In practice, however, modification of public and private structures to improve access is a work in progress, and many buildings are not easily accessible. Most tourist destinations around Slovenia are accessible by those with disabilities. Rental, repair, replacement parts for assistive devices, or service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants are widely available.

Solomon Islands,"Crime: Petty theft is common in some parts of Solomon Islands. Guided or group tours are generally safer than traveling alone. Landowners may demand money if you enter their land without permission. Home invasions, burglaries, and violent crime typically increase in the months approaching the Christmas holiday season. Yacht-related robberies can occur, usually at night while occupants are asleep. Most criminals are not deterred even when boats are anchored offshore. Visiting yachts should be wary of allowing strangers onboard and boaters should take precautions when leaving the vessel to go ashore. General Safety: You should travel in groups for safety and security, especially in the evening or at night. All water activities should be done in groups. Swimmers should be aware of saltwater crocodiles that can be found at the mouths of rivers emptying into the sea. Demonstrations occur frequently.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Local customary law is still observed in Solomon Islands, especially in rural areas. Disputes based in customary law are generally resolved through a compensation-based settlement mediated by law enforcement or local government officials. Some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consular Agency immediately. See our webpage for further information. Customs: The Solomon Islands' customs authorities enforce strict regulations for importing or exporting firearms and ammunition, pornography, and certain prescription drugs. Other items may be subject to quarantine regulations or import duty. The Solomon Islands' government prohibits the export of military artifacts from World War II. Contact the Solomon Islands' Mission to the United Nations for specific information regarding customs requirements. Unexploded Ordnance: Unexploded World War II ordnance remains in the Solomon Islands, particularly in the areas of Hell’s Point, the ridges behind Honiara, the New Georgia group of islands, Tulagi, and the Russel Islands. Be alert when hiking, boating, or diving. Be vigilant for ordnance and obey all posted warnings. Natural Disasters: Solomon Islands is subject to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and sudden tidal movements (tsunamis). The Pacific cyclone season extends from November through March.

Somalia,"The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Somalia due to the lack of a permanent consular presence in Somalia, including the Somaliland region. U.S. citizens can contact the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. In an emergency, you will have to rely on your own resources or journey to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate outside of Somalia. Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by foreigners Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including buses and scheduled commercial flights) Checkpoints Terrorist organizations and armed groups in Somalia attack government authorities and facilities; African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) personnel and bases; and civilian and non-governmental targets, including but not limited to hotels, restaurants, airports, seaports, and shopping areas. Inter-clan and factional violence are also regular occurrences throughout Somalia. Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa’ida-affiliated foreign terrorist organization based in Somalia, has repeatedly attacked Mogadishu’s Aden Adde International Airport (AAIA) and other locations in Somalia with mortars, small arms and light weapons, and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs). The group’s recent attacks include a March 23, 2022, small arms and mortar attack at the AAIA compound in Mogadishu, where the U.S. Embassy, several other diplomatic posts, and the UN offices are based, which killed seven people. Later the same day, two attacks in Beledweyne killed 48 and wounded 108. On January 12, 2022, a VBIED motorcade attack approximately four kilometers from the U.S. Embassy injured two U.S. citizen contractors and killed five non-U.S. citizen employees providing security and killed an unconfirmed number of bystanders. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for all of these attacks. While some areas have experienced less severe terrorist activity, such as the Somaliland region, where there have been no major terrorist attacks since 2008, terrorist attacks involving the indiscriminate use of explosive devices and other weapons can take place anywhere in Somalia at any time without warning. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Violent crime such as kidnapping, bombings, indirect fire attacks, murder, armed robbery, carjacking, and illegal roadblocks by armed individuals in uniforms occur throughout Somalia, including the self-declared autonomous region of Somaliland. Somali authorities have limited capacity and resources to investigate and prosecute criminal activity. U.S. citizens should: Avoid walking alone, especially at night. Avoid displaying cash and valuable personal property. Dress conservatively. Carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa. Keep original documents in a secure location. Maintain caution in areas frequented by foreigners. Be cautious when traveling in major cities and along border areas. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Cultural Rehabilitation Centers: Some schools and other facilities acting as “cultural rehabilitation” centers are operating in Somalia with inadequate or nonexistent licensing and oversight. Reports of minors and young adults being held in these facilities against their will and physically abused are common. Somalia-Kenya Border: Cross-border violence attributed to al-Shabaab and skirmishes between the Somali and Kenyan armies occurs periodically, including large-scale attacks against civilians, government security forces, and AMISOM troops. Kidnapping, IED, and grenade attacks targeting international aid workers and civilians occur. Al-Shabaab actively operates in border areas, including Kenya’s Lamu and Wajir counties. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Kenya for assistance. Report crimes to the nearest local police and contact the U.S. Embassy in Kenya at (254) (20) 363-6451 during business hours or (254) (20) 363-6000 outside business hours. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Contact relatives or friends with your written consent. Provide information on victim assistance resources in the United States . Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution. Help you find accommodation in Kenya and arrange flights home from Somalia or Kenya. Replace a stolen or lost passport at the U.S. Embassy in Kenya. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Kenya for assistance. Tourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure exists in Somalia. Tourists participate in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment are not available in Somalia. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","Water, health, and electricity systems in Somalia are poor. Medical care and services are extremely limited. Medicines are in short supply, and many pharmacies stock ineffective or counterfeit medications. Most care providers expect payment in U.S. dollars/Somali shillings prior to treatment. Ambulance services are not present or are unreliable in most areas except Mogadishu. Somalia Red Crescent Society services may be available in some areas in case of disasters/emergency. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Medical evacuation services in Somalia are extremely limited, and services responding from outside of the country will take more than six hours to respond. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Somali Ministry of Health to ensure the medication is legal in Somalia. Vaccinations: Be up to date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If you will be in Somalia for more than four weeks, the Somali government may require you to show proof of polio vaccination when you are exiting the country. If you were vaccinated against polio as a child but have never had a polio booster dose as an adult, or if you were not completely vaccinated as a child/do not know your vaccination status, talk to your doctor about getting vaccinated. To meet this requirement while in Somalia, you should receive a polio vaccine between 4 weeks and 12 months before the date you are leaving Somalia. Talk to your doctor about whether this requirement applies to you. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Air Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. embassies and consulates. Health facilities in general Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies. Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is generally unavailable. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment. Generally, in hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions. The following diseases are prevalent: African Tick Bite Fever Chikungunya Cholera Dengue Hantavirus Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Leishmaniasis Leptospirosis Malaria Measles Polio Rabies Schistosomiasis Tuberculosis (TB) Typhoid Yellow Fever Food-borne and water-borne illnesses are common. Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about resources for travelers regarding specific issues in Somalia .","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. You may be taken in for questioning by the police if unable to produce an acceptable form of identification. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs result in long prison sentences and heavy fines. Local courts operate under a combination of Somali customary and Islamic law, some of which may be hostile towards foreigners. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the relevant local authorities prior to practicing a profession or operating a business. Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification : Somali law enforcement officials routinely block access to foreign and dual nationals in detention. The U.S. Embassy in Kenya may not receive notification or be allowed access to you if you are detained. Furthermore, dual U.S.-Somali citizens are recognized as Somali citizens by authorities, which impedes our ability to provide any consular assistance. If you are arrested or detained, ask Somali police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy in Kenya immediately. The U.S. government’s ability to provide consular services across Somalia is severely restricted due to ongoing security concerns and the lack of a permanent consular presence in Somalia, including the Somaliland region See our webpage for further information. Photography: Do not take pictures of government buildings, military installations, or key infrastructure such as airports and border controls. You could be detained or arrested, fined, and have your equipment confiscated. Do not take photos of people without their permission. Phone Service: Cellular phones are used extensively. SIM cards can be purchased locally and used with a compatible cell phone. Currency: The Somali shilling is the unit of currency except in the Somaliland region, which uses the Somaliland shilling. Be advised that most Somali shillings in circulation are believed to be counterfeit. U.S. dollars are widely accepted. Credit cards and traveler's checks are generally not accepted, and you are advised against using your credit card in Somalia, even if accepted. It is not possible to obtain currency advances against a credit card. ATMs are increasingly available in Mogadishu. ATMs in Somalia disburse U.S. dollars. Faith-Based Travelers: See our webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI+ Travelers: Same-sex sexual contact is punishable by three months to three years in prison. Anti-discrimination provisions do not apply to LGBTI individuals. Society considers sexual orientation a taboo topic, so there is no known public discussion of this issue. Severe societal stigma typically prevents LGBTI individuals from making their sexual orientation publicly known. See our LGBTI travel information page and section 6 of our Human Rights Report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: The provisional constitution prohibits the state from discriminating against any person on the basis of disability. However, it makes no reference to discrimination in the private sector. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Few government buildings, schools, banks, or grocery stores have accessible facilities, including in Mogadishu. Some hospitals and clinics are equally inaccessible to people with disabilities and lack wheelchair ramps or lifts, including some of the hospitals travelers commonly use. Expect accessibility to be very limited in transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure, and largely absent outside of major cities. Much of the disability equipment for sale locally is refurbished rather than new. Replacement parts can be found in local informal markets and are also generally refurbished parts. Imported higher-end equipment such as electric wheelchairs and lifting equipment can be purchased from a very limited number of medical equipment suppliers in the major cities. Almost all supplies must be purchased and imported from overseas. Students: See our students abroad page and FBI travel tips . We are aware of allegations that some boarding schools in Somalia engage in abusive practices such as corporal punishment, physical restraint, and confiscation of travel documents. Youth: We are aware of cases of forced marriage. Some facilities involved in “cultural rehabilitation” (“dhaqan celis,” meaning “returning to Somali culture”) engage in abusive practices such as corporal punishment, physical restraint, and confiscation of travel documents. Women Travelers: There are no laws against spousal violence, including rape. There are documented patterns of rape perpetrated with impunity, particularly of displaced women and members of minority clans. Authorities rarely use formal structures to address rape. Survivors suffer from subsequent discrimination based on the attribution of “impurity.” Domestic and sexual violence against women remain serious problems, despite the provisional federal constitution provision prohibiting any form of violence against women. See our travel tips for women travelers . Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C): Although the provisional federal constitution prohibits the circumcision of girls, FGM/C is almost universally practiced throughout the country. Up to 98 percent of women and girls have reportedly undergone FGM/C, primarily between the ages of 5 and 14 years."
South Africa,"Alerts regarding important safety and security information such as demonstrations, road security, and weather events are posted on the Embassy’s website . In South Africa the equivalent to the “911” emergency line is 10111. The following paragraphs provide a summary, but please read the Department of State’s most recent Overseas Security Advisory Council Country Security Report on South Africa, which provides detailed information about safety and security concerns for travelers to South Africa. Civil Unrest: Strikes and demonstrations occur frequently. These can develop quickly without prior notification and occasionally turn violent, and may include the burning of vehicles, buildings, or tires – which may serve as roadblocks; throwing rocks or other objects; or physical attacks. Strikes and demonstrations can also interrupt traffic and the provision of electricity, water, public transportation, fuel, and other goods and services. Periodic incidents of mob violence directed against refugees and immigrants from other African countries occur in South Africa. During labor protests, strike breakers or those perceived to be strike breakers have been violently attacked. Protests involving taxis and ride hailing services can turn violent. See Travel and Transportation section below for guidance. Precautions: Avoid demonstrations and use vigilance during your movements around the country. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent. Maintain caution in areas frequented by foreigners. Monitor news and Alerts . Crime: Crime in South Africa is very high. Violent crimes happen in places where people live, work, travel, or go out. This includes armed home invasions by criminal groups, which lead to assaults, rapes, and murder. Popular tourist spots and big hotels have their own security to prevent these incidents. But visitors and residents are still affected by armed robbery, rape, kidnapping, carjacking, mugging, and ""smash-and-grab"" attacks on vehicles. It's important to be extra careful at traffic lights and on/off ramps where cars slow down or stop. To avoid being robbed when buying jewelry or electronics outside high-end stores, many vendors offer to deliver your purchase to your home or hotel for a fee. Crime can happen anywhere and at any time, even in and around Kruger National Park. U.S. government staff and visitors have been robbed near our diplomatic facilities. It's especially important to be cautious in the central business districts (CBDs) of major cities, especially after dark. Crime victims have also been followed from OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg and then robbed when they reach their home or hotel. Theft can be bold and in broad daylight. Travelers and U.S. diplomats report having cell phones stolen from their hands, as well as purses or wallets taken off counters while paying for goods at stores. Car theft and hijacking continues to plague the country, particularly in large cities. Travelers should choose secure parking options and double check locked doors before leaving a parked car. Throughout South Africa, U.S. citizens should: Avoid walking alone especially after dark. Avoid visiting informal settlement areas unless you are with someone familiar with the area. Please note that U.S. mission staff are required to use fully armored vehicles when visiting many townships in and around the Cape Town area and visiting hours are restricted to between 0700-1500 hours. Do not display cash and valuables. Avoid cash-in-transit vehicles both on the road, as well as ATMs when being refilled. Armed criminal gangs frequently target cash-in-transit vehicles while stopped at customer sites, but also ambush cash-in-transit vehicles while on the road. Such violent armed attacks involve automatic weapons, explosives, and gangs of criminals. Criminals frequently use remote jamming and signal interceptors with success. Drive with doors locked and windows closed. Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location. Avoid driving during periods of load shedding (rolling blackouts) as the roads can become extremely congested due to a lack of traffic signals. These traffic jams and slow-moving traffic can provide opportunities for smash and grab robberies. Student Groups: There have been instances of student groups being robbed while conducting outreach and service visits in townships. On these occasions, student groups coordinated with officials to conduct service visits and upon arrival were held and then robbed by armed perpetrators. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in South Africa. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Tips to avoid scammers: • Look for red flags such as individuals who say they live in a remote location, a profile that was recently created or seems to be too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or requests for money. Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages. Do a reverse image search on the profile picture. If the individual asking for help claims to be a U.S. citizen, rather than helping them, you should refer them to the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate so we can work with local authorities to assist them. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Technology Usage Abroad: Mobile devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad include keeping all software (for operating systems and apps) updated and using virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. GPS navigation apps . Prior to using the GPS navigation apps, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety consideration. Dating apps and websites . Be careful when using dating apps and online dating websites in foreign countries as scammers may target U.S. citizens. Let your friends and family know where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid eating or drinking anything suspicious. Don't go to bars or nightclubs alone. Credit cards and ATMs. Travelers need not surrender their credit card to any vendor. They will bring a credit card machine to customers. Be cautious when using ATMs outside of banks and reputable hotels because ATM and Credit Card skimming is common. Thieves may pretend to help you use a malfunctioning ATM and steal your ATM cards. Skimmers have also been found on machines used to pay parking tickets at shopping malls and office buildings. To avoid this risk, pay parking fees with cash. See the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault or domestic violence should report crimes to the local police at 10111. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . The U.S. Consulates General in South Africa can: help you find appropriate medical care assist you in reporting a crime to the police contact relatives or friends with your written consent explain the local criminal justice process in general terms provide a list of local attorneys provide information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S. provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution help you find accommodation and arrange flights home replace a stolen or lost passport Terrorism Threat: Extremists with ties to international terrorist organizations, such as al-Qai’ida, al-Shabaab, and ISIS, historically have used South Africa as a logistical hub to conduct recruitment and financial facilitation. There has been increased activity by ISIS sympathizers and supporters locally, including the placement of incendiary devices and kidnapping for ransom operations. South African authorities have periodically arrested individuals and charged them with terrorism related crimes. The U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control has publicly designated ISIS members operating in South Africa who have provided technical, financial, or material support to the terrorist group. Check the Mission’s website to review Alerts to U.S. citizens, and register with the U.S. Mission to South Africa to receive new Alerts by email during your travels. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Game parks and outdoor safety: Visitors have been injured and killed by wild animals in South Africa. It is dangerous to leave your vehicle in game parks outside of designated areas. Observe all park regulations and follow the instructions of guides. Be mindful of sharks when swimming. Rip tides are common and very dangerous. Do not swim alone in isolated areas or dive into unfamiliar waters. Hikers must be prepared for rapidly changing weather conditions and ensure they have proper clothing and supplies. Many areas, especially in the Western Cape province, experience brush fires during the summer months (December-February). These fires can burn for several days. Monitor local media and follow fire crew instructions regarding road closures and evacuations. Tourism: The tourism industry is regulated. Rules for best practices and safety inspections are enforced. Hazardous areas are marked with signs and professional staff are available for organized activities. If you get hurt, there is medical treatment available. Outside of big cities, it might take longer for help to come. It's a good idea for U.S. citizens to get medical evacuation insurance. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . Infrastructure: In the country, there are often scheduled blackouts called ""Load Shedding"". These blackouts are meant to protect the electrical grid, but they cause the whole country to lose power for up to six hours every day. This is bad for businesses that don't have another way to get power, like hotels. Load shedding also causes traffic lights to stop working, which leads to traffic jams and more crime. It can also affect access to water, cell phone signal, fuel availability, and safety features in rural areas.","For emergency services in South Africa, dial 10111 . Ambulance services are: not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards; not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except in major cities and may; not be equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.

Private medical facilities require a deposit before admitting patients. Pharmacies are well-stocked, but you should carry an adequate supply of prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. HIV and AIDS is a major public health concern. The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Private medical facilities will require payment before care is administered. See insurance providers for overseas coverage .

The following diseases are prevalent: Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Malaria Measles Rabies Typhoid Yellow Fever Leptospirosis Schistosomiasis African Tick-bite Fever Chikungunya Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Rift River Valley Avian/Bird Flu Hantavirus Tuberculosis (TB) Vaccinations: Be up to date on vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Air Quality: Visit Air Now Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in South Africa. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the Winter (Southern Hemisphere). People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens People over 65 years of age People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. People with heart disease or diabetes People who work or are active outdoors The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Adequate health facilities are available major cities but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies. Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on Medical Tourism. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to South Africa. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in South Africa. Although South Africa has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in South Africa, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available, and professionals are accredited and qualified. Pharmaceuticals Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescriptions, are often readily available for purchase with minimal regulation. Counterfeit medication is common and may be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Water Quality & Food Safety In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Altitude Johannesburg is at high altitude (5,751 feet). Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel.

South Korea,"Public Demonstrations: Demonstrations and rallies are common in South Korea, particularly near the U.S. Embassy, Seoul City Hall, and areas surrounding military installations. You should avoid areas where demonstrations are taking place and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or rallies. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. North Korea (The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, DPRK): An armistice agreement, monitored by the United Nations, has maintained general peace on the Korean peninsula since 1953. Tensions occasionally flare up because of provocative acts by North Korea, including ballistic missile and nuclear tests and limited armed incursions into ROK-held territory. Some provocations have escalated into geographically limited skirmishes. South Korea routinely conducts military training exercises and civil defense drills. North Korea often issues strongly-worded and threatening messages, frequently in connection with these exercises. Please see our Fact Sheet on North Korea . Weather-related Events: Heavy rains and flooding may occur during the June - August monsoon season or the May - November typhoon season. See general information about natural disaster preparedness at the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) website.

If the Embassy becomes aware of any specific and credible threat to the safety and security of U.S. citizens, we will inform you through our website, social media, and email. Crime: For most visitors, South Korea remains a very safe country. Common crimes occur more frequently in major metropolitan areas, tourist sites, and crowded markets. Take routine safety precautions. Pay attention to your surroundings. Report any concerns to local police. Violent crime is not common; however, remain vigilant: Exercise caution in crowded entertainment, nightlife, and shopping districts. If traveling at night, consider traveling in groups. Use legitimate taxis or public transportation only. Victims of Crime: Call 112 for emergency assistance or to report a crime to local authorities. Call 02-397-4114 to contact the U.S. Embassy.

Sexual Assault: The Embassy regularly receives reports of sexual assault from U.S. citizens. Most cases involved young women assaulted by acquaintances they met on social media, dating, or messaging apps. Alcohol is often involved, and Korea’s low overall crime can create a false sense of security.  Specialized hospital units and police are available in South Korea to assist victims, however services in English and responsiveness to the crime are not always consistent. In general, sex crimes are not punished as harshly in South Korea as in the United States and the road to prosecution is a challenging one for victims. Domestic Violence: Victim’s assistance resources or battered women’s shelters exist in Seoul and other urban areas but may be limited in rural areas. Most are government administered and require a police referral. Call 112 for emergency assistance or 1366 to reach Korea’s 24-hour domestic violence hotline. Victims may also contact the Embassy, tel. (+82) 2-397-4114. Lost or Stolen Passports: If your passport is stolen, file a report at the nearest police station. Don't buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if widely available. It is against South Korean law to purchase these goods and against U.S. law to bring them into the United States. The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Division in the U.S. Department of Justice has more information. Avoid fraud and scams: See Department of State and FBI websites for more information. Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.

See the U.S. Embassy Seoul, Health Information page . Traveling with Pets: See Korea’s Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency website. See the Korean Customs Regulations website for complete information. LGBTI Travelers: Consensual same-sex sexual activity is not criminalized. Korea is a conservative country in regards to LGBTI issues. However, there are an increasing number of LGBTI-oriented clubs, festivals and NGOs advocating for LGBTI issues. The ROK National Human Rights Commission Act prohibits discrimination against individuals because of their sexual orientation, but there are no laws specifying punishment for persons found to have discriminated on this basis. Same-sex marriages are not recognized. Korean citizens can legally change their gender identity. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of the Department of State's Human Rights report for further details. Mobility Issues: Korean law mandates access to transportation, communication, and public buildings. Cross walks typically have audio and visual signals. Older buildings and streets are generally less accessible than modern ones. Metro cars and buses in Seoul offer priority seating for the disabled and most metro stations have elevators. Metro platforms include Korean Braille information. Contact individual bus companies and subway associations for specific information. Foreign residents are eligible for disability assistance from local ward offices; assistance varies by ward."
South Sudan,"The U.S. Embassy’s ability to provide consular services outside of Juba, even in emergencies, is extremely limited. Land mines remain a hazard, especially outside of Juba. Armed conflict between various political and ethnic groups continues throughout the country. Exercise extreme care in all parts of the country, including Juba. Be vigilant when traveling outside of cities and avoid travel along border areas. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent. Monitor local/international news and consular messages . The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in South Sudan. Crime: The population has ready access to weapons due to years of civil war, inter- and intra-ethnic conflict, and political unrest. In Juba , the most frequently reported violent crimes include armed robbery, carjacking, and home invasion. Criminals target people who are walking, driving, traveling alone or in small groups, especially at night. Most criminal incidents affecting Westerners appear to target victims based on perceived wealth and vulnerability rather than nationality. Criminals frequently wear security service uniforms, carry military weapons, and use the ruse of security check points or official business to stop individuals or gain access to compounds. Outside Juba , road ambushes and roadside crime are common and often involve violence. Violent crimes (murder, armed robbery, home invasions, cattle raiding, kidnapping) and non-violent petty theft and fraud are pervasive. Throughout the country, crimes of opportunity include: Muggings Pickpocketing Theft from vehicles Fraudulent currency exchanges Thefts usually occur near restaurants, banks, or other areas in proximity of foreigners. Avoid walking alone, especially after dark. Do not display cash or valuables. Dress conservatively. Drive with doors locked and windows closed. Travel with a copy of your U.S. passport and visa. Keep original documents in a secure location. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.

Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with South Sudanese customs to ensure the medication is legal in South Sudan. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Air Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Health facilities in general: Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies. All hospitals and doctors require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. All hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities. Pharmaceuticals: Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and those requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Water Quality: In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Always ensure that the bottle is sealed and do not allow staff to open the bottle for you. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. The following diseases are prevalent: Cholera Diarrheal illnesses Hepatitis A Malaria Meningococcal disease Typhoid Yellow fever HIV/AIDS Rabies Polio Measles Dengue Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. South Sudan’s security services commit arbitrary arrests and often detain foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens. Extortion is common. Security forces often operate outside civilian control and do not always follow laws governing due process and treatment of detainees. U.S. citizens may have little recourse to justice should they be detained. Legal proceedings can be lengthy and subjective. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. South Sudanese law enforcement officials routinely block access to foreign nationals and dual nationals in detention. If you have reason to believe a U.S. citizen may be detained or incarcerated in South Sudan, do not assume the Embassy is already aware. Contact the Embassy and provide as much information as possible. Journalism: Reporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan and have been killed while covering the conflict. They have also reported being detained with no due process or deported from the country with no warning. Controlled Items: Certain items which are normal and legal to possess elsewhere are tightly controlled in South Sudan. Bringing them into the country without government permission, or even traveling internally with them, can result in extra scrutiny by security officials, the confiscation of your items, and your arrest. Metal detectors, which can be used for prospecting, are tightly controlled, especially if you are traveling to an area where mining takes place. Some forms of communication equipment such as satellite phones (commonly referred to by their trade names: Thurayas or Iridiums) are required to be registered with the government. Imports of any form of military material or “dual-use” items including their components are highly scrutinized, even if commercially available; this includes commercial drones. U.S. citizens should contact the Embassy of the Republic of South Sudan for questions regarding what equipment they may or may not import into the country and how to obtain authorizations for specific equipment or to bring in large sums of cash. Dual Nationals: The Embassy recommends all dual nationals obtain visas for their U.S. passport covering the duration of their stay in South Sudan. If staying longer than a typical visa will allow, dual nationals are strongly encouraged to obtain a five-year residency permit. These documents are available for a fee at any local Government of South Sudan Immigration office. Aid Workers: Consult with the security personnel representing your organization. Compounds housing aid workers have been breached and aid workers, including U.S. citizens, have been the targets of shootings, ambushes, violent assaults, harassment, and robberies. Currency: The South Sudanese pound (SSP) is the official currency. It is a cash exclusive society. Carry sufficient funds in to cover all your expenses for the duration of your stay. ATMs draw on local banks only. Exchange currency only at reputable banks. U.S. currency that is damaged or issued prior to 2006 is not accepted. Photography: For any photography, amateur and professional, a permit is required and may be obtained from the Ministry of Interior for $50. Even with a permit, you must be careful taking pictures, as police have arrested and physically assaulted tourists for using a camera. In addition, traveling with professional photography equipment will trigger extra scrutiny regardless of occupation. Never take pictures of government buildings, vehicles, or persons in uniform. Do not take pictures of infrastructure such as bridges or airports. Keep your camera concealed and do not take random photos in public. Do not take photos of South Sudanese without their permission and be courteous of those who shy away from having their pictures taken.

Spousal abuse is common and police seldom intervene. See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Spain,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on encouraging or conducting attacks worldwide, including within Europe. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Spain’s open borders with its Western European neighbors allow the possibility for terrorists to enter and exit the country anonymously. Additionally, Spain’s enclaves in Melilla and Ceuta on the North African coast allow for entry into Spain from the African continent. Spain has taken robust actions to guard against terrorist attacks, including arrests of suspected extremists allegedly involved in terrorist plots. Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue to plot potential attacks in Europe, including Spain. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Pickpocketing and other minor crimes, such as theft, are very common in Spain including instances where the victim is purposefully distracted to facilitate the theft. Street crimes against U.S. citizens usually occur in  tourist areas, including airports, train stations, and both urban and beach destinations . Violent crimes, including robberies, have also been reported. Some instances have required the victim to seek medical attention. Car break-ins are also frequent in Spain. Use common sense, awareness and the same personal security measures you would normally use in any large city or tourist destination. Keep track of your passport at all times, including on flights and other modes of transportation. There have been reports of passports being stolen on planes en route to Spain. Do not leave bags unattended. Keep them in sight and avoid placing passports, cash, cell phones, or other valuables in the outer pockets of backpacks or purses on tables or floors, grounds in public places. Do not leave bags slung over the backs of chairs, on hotel or store counters, on top of your suitcase or travel bag, or out of your physical control in hotel lobbies, car rental locations, train stations, restaurants, and other public places. Avoid carrying your passport unless needed for travel, especially in tourist areas. Instead, carry a photocopy or photo of your passport’s biographical information page and consider leaving your passport in a secure location, such as a hotel safe. Your passport will be required to check in into any hotel in Spain and may be required for trains or tourist sites. Sexual Assault: The U.S. Mission in Spain has received numerous reports of sexual assaults affecting U.S. citizens, especially younger travelers, students, and exchange teachers. Navigating the Spanish criminal justice system after surviving a sexual assault has been difficult for many U.S. citizen victims, who report feeling judged and re-victimized throughout the very lengthy process. Although it is not required, many U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault in Spain have found it helpful to hire a local attorney to be their advocate and defend their rights during any judicial process or use the help of the local Office of Victim’s Assistance. Information about the local victim’s assistance program is given out at the police station when the report is filed. There have been numerous reports alleging sexual assaults against U.S. citizen students by Manuel Blanco Vela, a representative of a tour operator based in Seville, Spain. Conduct research online to determine who owns and operates tour companies to make informed choices. Many sexual assaults occur at night or during the early morning hours. In most cases, assailants take advantage of alcohol or drugs to make victims more vulnerable.

International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Financial scams are prevalent in Spain. Beware of anyone asking for money, particularly people who establish a “romantic” relationship online or anyone who claims the Spanish authorities are asking them for money. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: People claiming to be U.S. military personnel Romance/Online dating Money transfers Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/Job offers Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated, and rules [with regards to best practices and safety inspections] are regularly enforced.

Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) The last terrorist attack in Sri Lanka occurred on April 19, 2019, when terrorists carried out coordinated bombings of hotels and churches in Colombo and Batticaloa, killing more than 250 people and injuring more than 500 more. The terrorists were Sri Lankan nationals associated with the Islamic groups National Thowheeth Jama’ath Millathu Ibraheem. Authorities believe the perpetrators of the attack are dead or have been captured. Many hotels and shopping areas increased their physical security presence in response to the bombings and security screenings of guests and bags has become standard in many locations. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Most crimes against U.S. citizens continue to be petty crime and crimes of opportunity (e.g., pickpocketing, hotel room thefts, and fraud). There is some organized criminal activity, which can involve drug-related crimes and gang-on-gang violence, but these events do not tend to involve foreign travelers. There are occasional reports of credit card fraud. Authorities have arrested foreign nationals and organized groups for complicity in financial crimes. Avoid situations where your card is removed from your view. There have been reports of employees at reputable businesses (e.g., restaurants or chain grocery stores) wearing data skimming devices in their clothing and scanning a victim’s credit card or using other methods to steal credit card information. ATM skimming is also a threat. If you use an ATM, be on the lookout for skimming devices. Cover keypads with your hand. Street hustlers are common around popular hotels, shopping areas, and other tourist sites. There are occasional reports of snatch and grab theft of purses or jewelry owned by tourists, but no recent reports of armed robberies.  Beware of tuk-tuk or taxi drivers offering “special” tours or access to festivals or gem shops. This common scam often results in tourists being heavily pressured to buy “gems” that are either cut glass or are worth much less than the price being asked. Likely due to Sri Lanka’s economic situation, there is a scam in which a tuk-tuk driver charges your ride using an app on their phone, claiming the meter is broken. When you get close to the destination, the phone either slips down or the app closes, and they charge a much higher amount than the routine cost. If a tuk-tuk does not have a meter, agree on a price before beginning the ride, and try to have the correct amount of cash so you do not need change. Surf schools are known to run scams where they claim renters damaged their boards and demand exorbitant prices to repair the damage. Examine and take pictures of your surfboard before taking it into the water. Sexual harassment is pervasive. Both foreigners and locals, more commonly women, report instances of cat calls and physical harassment (grabbing of body parts) while in crowded areas and/or public transportation. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Police may deploy water cannons and/or tear gas in response to violent protests. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. In general, demonstrations in Sri Lanka are peaceful, resulting only in traffic congestion. However, some have ended in violence between the protestors and police or opposition groups. Demonstrations can involve confrontations with police, resulting in the use of water cannons and tear gas to disperse crowds. Large political rallies are common. These rallies are generally peaceful but can disrupt traffic. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams occasionally occur in Sri Lanka. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited text messages and WhatsApp messages. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Contracts with promises of large commissions Work permits/job offers Tips to avoid scammers: Look for red flags like their location is far away, their profile was recently created or seems too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or they ask for money. Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages. Do a reverse image search on the profile picture. If they ask for help, you should refer them to the closest U.S embassy or consulate so we can assist them. Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs. Technology Usage Abroad: Mobile devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated, and use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact both the tourist police (hotline: 1912 or 011-242-1451) and the U.S. Embassy (011-202-8500) for assistance. Report crimes to both the tourist police and the U.S. Embassy. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Help you find appropriate medical care ; Assist you in reporting a crime to the police; Contact relatives or friends with your written consent; Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation  and following its conclusion; Provide a list of local attorneys ; Provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S. ; Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution; Help arrange flights home; and Replace a stolen or lost passport . Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","Ambulance Services: For ambulance services in the Sri Lanka, dial 1990. Ambulance services are widely available, but response times vary, and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Ambulances are typically not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health webpage and general Traveler Advice for Sri Lanka. Select your destination on the right side of the Travelers’ Health webpage . Review all sub-sections including the Travel Health Notices, Vaccines and Medicines, Non-Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Stay Healthy and Safe, Healthy Travel Packing List, and After Your Trip. Review the Traveler Advice webpage that provide advice on medical considerations including: Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel) Travelers with Special Considerations (for example: Allergies, Long-Term Travelers and Expatriates) General Tips (for example: Traveling with Medications, Travel Vaccines) The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. The Department of State strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Medical Facilities: There are six large hospitals in the Colombo area, including four facilities with emergency medical and trauma service: Asiri Surgical Hospital; Lanka Hospital; Asiri Central Hospital; and the government-run National Hospital of Sri Lanka. Medical facilities outside Colombo are limited. Hospitals and doctors typically require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. The availability of medical supplies is uneven; therefore, travelers should always carry any prescription medications with them. Serious medical conditions can require evacuation to the United States or to a nearby country with more advanced medical facilities, such as Thailand or Singapore. Neither Thailand nor Singapore require U.S. citizens to have entry visas. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. Pharmaceuticals: Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescriptions in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. Please visit U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with Sri Lanka's Ministry of Health to ensure the medication is legal in Sri Lanka. Air Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. Water Quality: In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Infectious Diseases: Several mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue fever, Chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis are present in Sri Lanka. Dengue fever, in particular, is widespread in Sri Lanka’s Western Province, where the capital Colombo is located. Adequate mosquito protection is strongly advised to prevent this serious illness. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recommended vaccines that are specific to this region include Japanese encephalitis and typhoid (and rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis for some travelers). For additional health information about Sri Lanka, please visit: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. If you break local laws in Sri Lanka, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. It’s very important to know what is legal and what is not where you travel. In places like military checkpoints, you may be taken in for questioning if you do not have your passport with you. When arriving in Sri Lanka, ensure your luggage does not contain prohibited or restricted items, such as weapons, ammunition, explosives, gold, narcotics, and pornography. In some places, it is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Sri Lanka are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Under the Cultural Prosperity Act and the Antiques Ordinance, the unlicensed export of antiques from the country is considered a criminal act. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask the police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries and they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website and U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Special Circumstance : Sri Lanka recognizes limited dual nationality . For further information, please contact the Sri Lankan Embassy in Washington, D.C., the Consulate General in Los Angeles, or the Sri Lankan Mission to the United Nations in New York City. The Sri Lankan police and military maintain several checkpoints throughout the country. U.S. citizens are advised to always carry identification such as their passports with them while in Sri Lanka. Photography is prohibited in designated high security zones and near many government facilities such as offices and military installations. U.S. citizens who arrive by yacht or private boat should be aware that all marine harbors are high security zones. Travelers arriving by sea should be prepared for Sri Lankan Navy officials to inspect their vessels and should always wait for radio clearance before coming into port. Religious Laws: Tourists should be mindful of restrictions and observances when planning to visit any religious establishment, whether Buddhist or Hindu temples, mosques, churches, or other locations considered sacred by the local population. Posing for a photograph with your back to a statue of Buddha is a serious offense in Sri Lanka, punishable by a fine or arrest. Travelers should also be cognizant of displaying religious imagery, including tattoos of Buddha, while traveling to and transiting within the country, as foreign nationals have been arrested or denied entry to Sri Lanka due to such tattoos. Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports International Volunteers: Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad Women Travelers: If you find yourself in a life-threatening situation, you are encouraged to call the tourist police immediately (hotline: 1912 or 011-242-1451) and follow up with a call to the U.S. Embassy (011-202-8500). We can sometimes connect you with a non-governmental organization in Sri Lanka that may be able to provide assistance. If you are victimized overseas, you may be entitled to receive compensation for counseling and/or other services such as relocation back to the United States. For further information, visit the U.S. Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women . Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes committed in Sri Lanka. See our tips for Women Travelers . Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . LGBTQI+ Travelers : See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights Report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: While in Sri Lanka, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what you find in the United States. The Sri Lankan Supreme Court has directed that steps be taken to provide easy access for persons with disabilities to public buildings. Although there are regulations on accessibility in place, lack of wheelchair access in most buildings limits access for people with disabilities. Potholes and sidewalks in poor repair can make movement very difficult. The road network in Sri Lanka is improving, but many roads remain in medium to poor condition. Sidewalks and road crossings in most major towns tend to be congested with vendors, stray dogs, and groups of people loitering on street corners."
Sudan,"Terrorism: Members and individual sympathizers of known terrorist groups and hardline political extremists could attack with little or no warning, targeting foreign and local government facilities and areas frequented by Westerners. Globally, terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Violence continues along the border between Chad and Sudan and areas near the border with South Sudan (including the disputed Abyei area). Armed opposition groups are active in Central Darfur state. Landmines and other explosive remnants of war still exist in rural areas; Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, Darfur, and the Eastern states, including along the Eritrean border, are the most affected. Border closures may occur without notice. Intercommunal and intracommunal clashes can occur throughout the country and can result in the declaration of localized states of emergency; civilians have been killed and government and security installations have been attacked. Blue Nile Region (Blue Nile, Sennar, and White Nile states) and Southern Kordofan Region (includes Abyei region, North Kordofan; South Kordofan; West Kordofan): While violence has decreased significantly from previous years, tensions remain high. Banditry and intercommunal violence are common in these regions. Armed actors may transit the shared borders with South Sudan and Ethiopia. Darfur Region: Flares of deadly intercommunal conflict continue, as does violence perpetrated by bandits and militias. Criminality, looting, and conflict over economic resources (land, gold, livestock) also is common. Tensions within camps for internally displaced people have resulted in fatalities and violence. Extrajudicial mobs and armed communal militia may mobilize quickly. Armed actors may transit Sudan’s shared borders with Chad and Central African Republic. Eastern Sudan (Kassala, Gedaref, and Red Sea States): Escalating tensions between Ethiopia and Sudan have prompted a sizeable build-up of military forces along the disputed border in Gedaref’s Fashaga region as well as recurring military-to-military engagements, clashes involving Ethiopian militias, and intercommunal reprisals over farmland. Incidents of cross-border criminality to include kidnapping have occurred. Human traffickers and organized crime syndicates are known to operate in the Kassala area (Kassala, Al Qadarif, and Red Sea states) along the Ethiopian and Eritrean borders. Stay on major roads if you are traveling by vehicle due to potential landmines and other explosive remnants of war. Crime: Crime, such as kidnapping, armed robbery, home invasion, and carjacking, can occur, though such crimes are more frequent outside of Khartoum. In Khartoum, home invasion, pickpocketing, purse snatching, theft from vehicles, and other petty crime occur, and the number of petty crimes has increased over the past year. There is a risk of kidnapping. Expatriates are not generally targeted for crime in Khartoum, but may be caught in a ‘wrong place, wrong time’ situation. Elsewhere in Sudan, particularly in Darfur, armed robbery, kidnapping, carjacking, and looting is common; victims may be targeted based on perceived wealth or affiliation, and aid workers continue to be affected by such crimes. Banditry is prevalent throughout western Sudan, particularly in the Darfur and Chad–Sudan border regions, where several incidents have resulted in deaths. Sexual assault is widespread in areas of armed conflict. Avoid walking or traveling alone, especially after dark and particularly outside of Khartoum. Do not display cash and valuable personal property. Dress conservatively in clothing which covers the shoulders, upper arms, and legs to below the knee. Drive with doors and windows locked. Travel with a copy of your U.S. passport and Sudanese visa to prevent the originals from being taken. Keep original documents in a secure location. Use reputable travel firms, knowledgeable guides, and drivers. Demonstrations: Small gatherings and demonstrations can occur with no warning and may escalate to violence. Protests are a regular occurrence since the 2019 revolution, with the pace increasing following the October 25, 2021 military takeover. Police and other security forces may intervene to disperse demonstrators, including with the use of tear gas and, in some instances, live ammunition, when protests occur near key governmental locations and/or impair freedom of movement. Protests and demonstrations have led to extended disruptions to telecommunications and, in some instances, airport closures, inhibiting U.S. citizens’ abilities to communicate with friends and family or depart the country. Historical anniversaries, calls for justice, and economic grievances, including bread, cooking oil, and fuel shortages, can precipitate demonstrations. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Follow the advice of local authorities. Maintain several days’ supply of food and water and stay indoors until the demonstration has passed. Keep a low profile and observe all curfews. Have alternate means of communication in the event of disruptions to telecommunication services. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.

U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","Consult the CDC website for Sudan prior to travel. Medical facilities in Khartoum are adequate for routine care, but the hospitals are not suitable for more serious medical problems. Outside the capital, few facilities exist, hospitals and clinics are poorly equipped, and ambulance services are unavailable. Medicines are available only intermittently. Emergency medical treatment is provided for 24 hours before payment is required. For all other care, providers expect payment in Sudanese pounds in full before treatment is performed. For emergency services in Sudan, dial 333. Ambulance services are: not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Khartoum. not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs can result in long jail sentences and heavy fines. While the consumption of alcohol is no longer prohibited for non-Muslims, regulations and enforcement remain unclear. You may be detained for questioning by the police if unable to produce an acceptable form of identification. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Travel Permits: A permit, obtainable from the Ministry of Tourism by your hotel or travel agent, is required for travel outside of the greater Khartoum area. A copy of the permit will be sent to the Aliens Department at the Ministry of Interior. A separate travel permit is required for travel to Darfur. The Embassy’s ability to provide consular services outside of Khartoum, including emergency assistance, is severely limited. Carry multiple copies of permits, as travelers without permits may be detained and arrested. Photography: Do not take photographs of any areas which may be sensitive to the government, including police and military installations, camps for internally displaced persons, and border areas. Photography requires a permit from the External Information Centre in Khartoum (part of the Ministry of Information). Even with a permit, it is illegal to take pictures of military installations, public utilities, infrastructure (e.g., bridges, airports), slum areas, or beggars. Do not take photographs or use equipment with cameras (including cell phone camera and laptops) close to government buildings. You could be fined, have your photographic equipment confiscated without notice, and risk detention and arrest. Do not take photos of Sudanese without their permission. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. The U.S. Embassy will not receive notification of your arrest. Moreover, dual U.S.-Sudanese nationals will be prosecuted as Sudanese citizens, impeding our ability to provide consular services. Sharia Law/Customs: Personal status laws govern legal procedures pertaining to family relations, including marriage, divorce, child custody, maintenance (financial support), and inheritance. We strongly advise you seek local legal counsel if you must engage in local legal matters and make certain you are aware of your rights and responsibilities. Some national laws reflect a sharia system of jurisprudence. Non-Muslims are sometimes convicted of offenses based on officials’ interpretation of Islamic law. The government enacted legislation in July 2020 that removed flogging as a punishment for criminal and civil crimes. However, flogging remains a common sentence for hudud, which are punishments mandated under Islamic law for serious offenses. Non-Muslim women are not expected to wear a veil or cover their heads. Both women and men should dress modestly. Shorts are not appropriate. Public displays of affection are discouraged. Pornography is not permitted. Government offices and businesses follow an Islamic workweek (Sunday to Thursday). Phone Service: Cellular phones are common, as other telephone service is unreliable and landlines are nearly non-existent. It may be possible to purchase a SIM card locally and use a U.S.-compatible cell phone. Check for compatibility with local cellular networks with your phone carrier or manufacturer before you go. During periods of civil unrest, Sudanese authorities may cut all telecommunications for extended periods of time. Maintain alternate means of communication in such an event. Currency: The Sudanese pound (SDG) is the official currency. Sudan operates on a cash-only economy; U.S.-issued credit and debit cards do not work. Carry sufficient funds in U.S. dollars to cover all your expenses for the duration of your stay. Bills must be printed after 2006 and unblemished. Do not carry a large amount of cash because travelers carrying large amounts of U.S. currency have been detained and currency confiscated. Sudan has no international ATMs. Local ATMs draw on local banks only. Western Union operates in Khartoum only. Exchange currency only at reputable banks. Exchanging currency outside of official banking channels is illegal and is punishable by imprisonment and fines. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: Sudanese law does not specifically prohibit homosexuality but criminalizes sodomy, which is punishable if convicted by five years in jail for an initial offense. Sudan’s civilian-led transitional government abolished corporal and capital punishment for conviction of sodomy. LGBTI persons are not considered a protected class under antidiscrimination laws. Anti–LGBTI sentiment remains pervasive in society. LGBTI organizations have alleged being pressured to alter their activities due to threat of harm. There have been no reports of official action to investigate or punish those complicit in LGBTI-related discrimination or abuses. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section six of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Access to transportation, lodging, and public buildings is limited for people with mobility issues. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and most buildings lack functioning elevators. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: Early and forced marriage of children continues. While Sudan has criminalized Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), the national prevalence rate of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting is 88 percent. Spousal abuse is common. Women who file claims of domestic violence are subjected to accusations of spreading false information, harassment, and detention. Police normally do not intervene in domestic disputes. Rape is a serious problem throughout the country, especially in conflict areas. See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."
Suriname,"Crime: There is limited police presence outside of Paramaribo.  Pickpocketing and robbery are common in Paramaribo’s business and shopping districts.

European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks, but all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. For more information, see our Terrorism page . Crime: Sweden has a low crime rate, and most crimes involve the theft of personal property from vehicles, residences, and public areas. While armed violence against the public continues to be a rare occurrence, violent crimes, such as homicides and sexual assaults, can occur. The majority of violent crimes occur in Sweden’s larger cities, such as Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmo. Organized crime groups have also committed armed acts against each other. Pickpocketing and petty theft are common in and around major tourist attractions, especially Stockholm’s Old Town (“Gamla Stan”) as well as at restaurants, coffee shops, amusement parks, museums, bars, airports, and on public transportation. Hotel breakfast rooms and lobbies attract well-dressed, professional thieves who blend in with guests and target purses and briefcases left unguarded by tourists and business travelers. Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are counterfeit goods illegal to bring back into the United States, but if you purchase them, you may also be breaking local law. Demonstrations occur frequently.

Syrian Arab Republic,"The Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens against travel to Syria and strongly recommends that U.S. citizens remaining in Syria depart immediately, if they are able to depart safely, per the U.S. Department of State’s Syria Travel Advisory . Over the past twelve years, the Syrian regime has committed and continues to commit a wide range of atrocities, some of which constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Violent conflict between government and anti-government groups continues throughout the country. Syrian regime military operations have involved the use of ballistic missiles, aerial attacks, heavy artillery, and chemical weapons that have struck civilian populations and infrastructure. Attacks from the regime or other groups could happen with little or no warning. No part of Syria should be considered immune from violence, and the potential risk exists throughout the country for unpredictable and hostile acts, including kidnappings, sniper assaults, terrorist attacks, small arms fire, improvised explosives, artillery shelling, airstrikes, the use of chemical weapons, large and small-scale bombings, as well as, wrongful detention, torture, sexual and gender-based violence, and extrajudicial killings. Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Syria has been designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism since 1979 and has given support to a variety of terrorist groups, affecting the stability of the region. Some parts of Syria, such as Idlib Province, are controlled by designated terrorist groups and are home to a number of groups hostile to the United States. Terrorists often do not distinguish between U.S. government personnel and private U.S. citizens. Terrorists may target areas frequented by Westerners, such as tourist sites, hotels, restaurants, and other frequently visited areas. U.S. citizens still in Syria are strongly encouraged to depart Syria immediately. U.S. citizens who choose to remain despite this warning should maintain a high level of vigilance and be aware of their surroundings. It is especially important for travelers to be unpredictable in their movements by varying times and routes and maintaining a low profile. Elements within the regime as well as non-state actor groups maintain anti-U.S. or anti-Western sentiment, which may intensify following significant events in the region, particularly those related to U.S.-Syria relations, international intervention in the ongoing conflict, Israeli-Palestinian issues, the status of Jerusalem, and clashes in Lebanon. The combination of terrorist organizations, a porous border with Iraq and long-standing border issues with all of its neighbors (Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Türkiye, and Israel) have made Syria a destabilizing factor in the region and a potential target for reprisal. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Since the suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Damascus in February of 2012, the U.S. government has not been able to provide accurate information about crime involving U.S. citizens visiting or living in Syria. The Department of State strongly recommends that U.S. citizens remaining in Syria depart immediately. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Syria. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers (Cryptocurrency, gift cards/prepaid cards, etc) Victims of Crime: If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime abroad, you should contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Czechia, through the U.S. Interests Section of the Czech Embassy in Damascus, currently serves as the Protecting Power for U.S. interests in Syria; however, their ability to provide services is extremely limited. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . The U.S. Interests Section, in coordination with nearby U.S. embassies and consulates, may be able to: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Explain the local criminal justice process in general terms Provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Assist you to replace a stolen or lost passport The local equivalents to the “911” emergency line in Syria is 110 for ambulance, 113 for fire, and 112 for the police. Syrian operators usually do not speak English. Any contact with Syrian security services has the potential to result in wrongful detention or disappearance. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the U.S. Interests Section of the Czech Embassy in Damascus or U.S. Embassy Amman for assistance. Tourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response services and subsequent appropriate medical treatment are largely unavailable in Syria. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . Syrian Conflict: The Syrian Arab Republic is ruled by an authoritarian regime dominated by the Socialist Ba'ath Party currently engaged in an armed conflict with the armed Syrian opposition. Sources estimate that the conflict has resulted in over 500,000 deaths with hundreds of thousands more wounded, detained, or forcibly disappeared. The Syrian conflict has resulted in over 5.6 million registered Syrian refugees, and approximately 6.9 million people are displaced inside Syria, while 4.53 million remain in hard-to-reach and besieged areas. The Syrian government and its partners continue to prohibit the free flow of humanitarian aid into besieged areas, resulting in severe food shortages. More than 14 million people in Syria need humanitarian assistance. Since September 2014, the U.S. government and others in the Defeat-ISIS Coalition have conducted military strikes on Syrian territory. Entities Operating in Syria: The Syrian government has regained control over most of the country, but some competing entities maintain greater control and influence in areas of northern Syria. Additionally, areas of southern Syria controlled by the Syrian government are constantly challenged by armed groups. Some armed groups have used car bombs, improvised explosive device/indirect-fire attacks, sniper fire, and carried out kidnappings throughout the country. Foreign combatants – including members of Iranian-aligned militia groups, Hizballah fighters, violent Islamist extremists, ISIS, and al-Qa'ida (AQ) elements – are also participating in hostilities. Additionally, Türkiye has become increasingly involved in military operations throughout northern Syria, seeking to counter the influence of the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK), a designated terrorist organization. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly known as al-Nusrah Front, an AQ affiliate and designated terrorist organization, has consolidated power in the northwestern province of Idlib. HTS control over Idlib threatens the ability of NGOs and states to deliver humanitarian aid to Syrians living there. Russian and/or Syrian government forces continue to conduct airstrikes in Idlib province. Strikes have resulted in civilian fatalities, including of medical personnel, children, and internally displaced persons and caused significant damage to civilian infrastructure such as medical facilities, schools, markets, and civilian housing. ISIS no longer controls territory in Syria but continues to operate as an insurgency throughout the country. ISIS continues to pose a significant threat to civilians residing in Syria and has demonstrated the ability to conduct coordinated attacks against armed actors and civilians. Tactics of ISIS, HTS, and other violent extremist groups include the use of suicide bombers, kidnapping, small and heavy arms, improvised explosive devices, and chemical weapons. They have targeted major city centers, road checkpoints, border crossings, government buildings, energy infrastructure, shopping areas, and open spaces in Damascus, Aleppo, Hamah, Dara, Homs, Idlib, Deir Ezzor provinces and parts of northeast Syria. These groups have murdered, kidnapped or taken hostage U.S. citizens, both for ransom and political purposes; in some instances, U.S. citizens have disappeared within Syria. The U.S. government’s ability to help U.S. citizens kidnapped or taken hostage is very limited. Chemical Weapons: In the past, the Syrian regime has repeatedly used chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin and chlorine gas, against civilians. ISIS has also conducted several sulfur mustard attacks in Syria. Although there has not been a documented chemical weapons attack in Syria since May 2019, the continuing violence, security situation, and ongoing concerns about Syria’s remaining chemical weapons capabilities contributes to a volatile situation. Kidnapping, Hostage Taking, and Forced Disappearance: There is an ongoing, high risk of kidnapping or hostage taking of U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a specific target, with several high-profile abductions having occurred since mid-2012.  U.S. citizen victims have had diverse professional backgrounds, including journalism and humanitarian work. U.S. citizens held captive by ISIS have been murdered by the group, which released videos of killings and publicly took responsibility for their deaths. U.S. citizens also have been abducted by other individuals and groups in Syria, and from various locations, including Damascus and Aleppo. Other U.S. citizens have gone missing and are believed to have been kidnapped or taken hostage. Forced disappearance is also used by government security forces on a massive scale to spread fear, stifle dissent, and as punishment. Detention Issues: U.S. citizens are also targets of abduction and wrongful detention by the Syrian regime. Family members seeking to obtain information about their missing or detained loved ones themselves face risk of detention, abuse, and exploitation when inquiring directly with the regime. Detainees are often held in detention centers for years under harsh and unsanitary conditions without any information provided to their loved ones on their status. These conditions allow for the quick spread of various illnesses. Pervasive abuse of detainees has been documented in government detention centers, including sexual and gender-based violence as well as other forms of physical violence, and extrajudicial killings. Please see our Human Rights Report regarding these conditions. Borders: A porous border with Iraq, and long-standing border issues with Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Türkiye, and Israel, have contributed to a complex security environment in Syria, compounded by a protracted violent conflict and influx of foreign fighters. Since 2012, there have been multiple reports of Syrian shelling of neighboring countries near border areas, most significantly in Lebanon, Türkiye, Israel, and Jordan. U.S. citizens should increase their vigilance if they travel within Syria to border areas with Iraq or Israel or the Al-Jazira (eastern Syria) region. The Government of Türkiye severely restricts crossings of its border with Syria, limited exclusively to individuals working for organizations engaged in the authorized provision of humanitarian assistance. Individuals seeking emergency medical treatment or safety from immediate danger are assessed on a case-by-case basis. U.S. citizens have reported facing dangers traveling within the country and when trying to leave Syria via land borders, given the diminished availability of commercial air travel out of Syria. Opposition-held border checkpoints should not be considered safe, as they are targeted by regime attacks and some armed groups have sought funding through kidnappings for ransom. Border areas are frequent targets of shelling and other attacks and are crowded because of internally-displaced persons. Errant attacks will occasionally hit border towns just outside the borders as well. Engaging in Armed Conflict: The U.S. government strongly warns U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including kidnapping, injury, or death. The U.S. government does not support this activity, and our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are arrested, injured, or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited. Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of financial and material support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and HTS/al-Nusrah Front, is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines. Individuals who demonstrate an interest in groups opposing ISIS, including on social media, could open themselves to being targeted by ISIS itself, especially if those individuals travel to Syria. Government Surveillance: The Syrian government conducts intense physical and electronic surveillance of both Syrian citizens and foreign visitors on a domestic and global scale. Any encounter with a Syrian citizen could be subject to scrutiny by the General Intelligence Directorate (GID) or other security services. Sustained interactions with average Syrians – especially if deemed to be of a political nature – may subject you and/or that Syrian to harassment and/or detention, and other forms of repressive actions by state security elements. Hotel rooms, internet connections, telephones, and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. The regime has reportedly planted spyware and other malware in Android applications to target human rights activists, opposition members, and journalists. Loitering or taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in questioning, confiscation of the images, or detention by security services. Additionally, U.S. citizens should be aware that conversations on the topics of politics, religion, and other social issues could lead to arrest. It is also illegal in Syria to possess specific-use electronic devices including GPS, short-wave or handheld radio equipment, or similar devices.","Basic medical care and medicines are available in Damascus and some coastal areas, but not necessarily in other areas. Serious illnesses and emergencies may require evacuation to a neighboring country or Western medical facility. There are shortages of food, water, medicine, and medical supplies throughout Syria. For emergency services in Syria, dial 110 for ambulance and 113 for fire. Ambulance services are not present throughout the country, except in the capital and provincial cities. The Department of State does not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Find out if your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas, though hospitals and doctors abroad may not accept it. Care providers in Syria only accept cash payments up front, and the cost for services can be expensive. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. The Department strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. In addition, you may wish to check whether your insurance will cover injuries sustained in a conflict zone. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the Government of Syria to ensure that the medication is legal in Syria. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The following diseases are prevalent: Tuberculosis Measles Polio Typhoid Hepatitis A Diarrheal disease Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Air Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Syria imposes more severe penalties for certain crimes than you might face in the United States. For example, Article 39 of Syria’s Narcotics Act imposes the death penalty for drug trafficking or cultivation. Women who are arrested under suspicion of immoral behavior (e.g., being alone in a room with a man who is not the woman’s husband or being in a residence where drugs or alcohol are being consumed) may be subjected to a virginity test. In addition, the Syrian government monitors the activities of all groups, including religious groups, and discourages proselytizing, which it deems a threat to relations among religious groups. Certain actions of U.S. citizens overseas are prosecutable as crimes in in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: Immediately request that the U.S. Interests section be notified if you are detained, though Syrian authorities generally do not notify the U.S. Interests Section of the arrest of a U.S. citizen until weeks after the arrest, if at all. In previous cases security officials have not responded to U.S. requests for consular access, especially in cases of persons detained for “security” reasons. See our webpage for further information on consular notification and access. Military Service: U.S.-Syrian and U.S.-Palestinian men who have never served in the Syrian military and who are planning to visit Syria despite the U.S. Department of State’s Syria Travel Advisory should contact the Syrian government prior to traveling concerning compulsory military service. See the “Dual Nationals” section above. Special Circumstances: Syria is in the midst of a violent armed conflict. The Department of State strongly recommends that U.S. citizens remaining in Syria despite the U.S. Department of State’s Syria Travel Advisory depart immediately. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has increased hardships in Syria. Communications in Syria are difficult as phone and internet connections are unreliable. Customs Requirements: Syrian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Syria of items such as weapons, narcotics, alcohol, tobacco, cheese, fruit, pharmaceuticals, modems, cosmetics, and some electrical appliances. Please refer to our Customs Information page for additional information. Banking and Commerce: Foreign currencies can be exchanged for Syrian pounds only by licensed money changers, the Commercial Bank of Syria (CBS), the Real Estate Bank, and at private banks, some of which maintain offices inside four- and five-star hotels. Four and five-star hotels and high-end stores in Syria generally accept credit cards, although most restaurants, stores and shops operate exclusively in cash. Foreigners visiting Syria are required to pay hotel bills in U.S. dollars, Euros, or other non-Syrian hard currency. Traveler’s checks are not accepted in Syria and banks will not cash them unless the traveler has an account at the bank in question. There are no U.S.-based banks operating in Syria. There are 14 private banks operating in Syria, with branches and ATMs in most major cities. These ATMs usually honor major debit/credit systems. U.S. banks are restricted by law from transacting business with the largest public bank in Syria, the CBS. Therefore, U.S. banks will not process ATM transactions from CBS branches. Funds may be transferred into Syria through Western Union. Wiring of funds through private banks is possible only if the traveler already holds an account with the bank in Syria; transferring funds through CBS or the Real Estate Bank is not possible because of U.S. sanctions. Private citizens seeking to transfer funds outside of Syria or to withdraw U.S. dollars from a bank in Syria should check with the relevant financial institution for the most up-to-date regulations. Trade and Sanctions: The United States maintains a robust sanctions regime on Syria. The Syrian government is under comprehensive sanctions, including for its atrocities, some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Syria sanctions prohibit a wide range of transactions in Syria, including with sanctioned entities, unless authorized by the Department of the Treasury or the Department of Commerce. Please consult the Department of Treasury and Department of Commerce websites for more details. Requests for specific licenses to authorize transactions that are neither exempt nor covered by a general license may be submitted to the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Terrorism List Government Sanctions Regulations prohibit U.S. persons from receiving unlicensed donations from the Syrian government. You can review the Department of Treasury’s Syria Sanctions page for more information. Additionally, U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in financial transactions which a U.S. person knows or has reasonable cause to believe pose a risk of furthering terrorist acts in the United States. For additional information about Terrorism List Government Sanctions Regulations, consult the terrorism brochure on the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s OFAC home page or via OFAC's info-by-fax service at (202) 622-0077. Faith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country report Human Rights Report – see country report Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: Syrian law criminalizes consensual same-sex conduct under penal code article 520, which states that each sexual act ""against the order of nature"" is punishable by as long as three years imprisonment. Rather than prosecute under that law, however, the regime has arrested dozens of LGBTQI+ persons on charges such as abusing social values; selling, buying, or consuming illegal drugs; or organizing and promoting “obscene” parties. Credible NGOs report that the Syrian regime uses detention centers to torture and commit acts of sexual and gender-based violence against suspected members of the LGBTQI+ community. Abuses include rape, forced nudity, and anal or vaginal “examinations.” Individuals perceived as LGBTQI+ report being sexually abused and harassed at checkpoints. Public reports indicate that ISIS and HTS murder individuals perceived to be LGBTQI+, inclusive of those accused of engaging in same-sex sexual conduct. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for additional information. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Syrian law protects persons with disabilities from discrimination in education, access to health, or provision of other state services; however, the government has not enforced these provisions. Sidewalks are generally unevenly paved and often blocked by parked cars. Stairs must be used to access many public buildings, restaurants, cafes, and other tourist spots.

Tajikistan,"Potential for Terrorist Activity: Terrorist organizations, including ISIS, have a presence in the region. Their activities mostly include recruiting sympathizers and followers through online platforms and social media, with the aim of conducting terrorist attacks in Tajikistan and other countries. While attacks are rare in Tajikistan, terrorists have planned and carried out attacks against foreigners and government entities, such as law enforcement and security services. Tajik authorities maintain a high level of security to thwart terrorist attacks. This could lead terrorists to seek softer targets including facilities where U.S. citizens and other foreigners congregate such as residential areas; clubs and restaurants; markets; places of worship; schools; hotels; outdoor recreational events, including popular hiking areas; and resorts. U.S. citizens should avoid predictable patterns of movement and revealing their personal information and location on social media. If using social media, ensure your privacy settings are appropriately set. U.S. Embassy Dushanbe employs heightened security precautions. U.S. citizens should report any unusual activity to local authorities and then inform the Embassy. Border Areas with Afghanistan: Reconsider travel near and along Tajikistan’s border with Afghanistan due to terrorism. The current political situation in Afghanistan creates a challenging and unpredictable environment in the border areas due to evolving security conditions. Additionally, the land border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan has been closed since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. Travel in the mountainous region along the Afghan border can be dangerous due to the proximity of militant groups across the border. Militant groups have attempted cross-border rocket attacks and armed incursions into Tajikistan. Be vigilant when camping, biking, or sheltering in the open after dark. U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid activities that develop predictable patterns of movement. If documenting travel on social media, please ensure your privacy settings are appropriately set. Restricted Zone of Gorno-Badakhshan: Reconsider travel to Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO). The current political situation in Afghanistan creates a challenging and unpredictable environment in the border areas due to evolving security conditions. Do not enter the Gorno-Badakhshan (GBAO) region without official permission. Persons violating the law may be detained by Tajik law enforcement. Violent clashes with security forces erupted in GBAO in recent years, and the government of Tajikistan can suspend travel permits for non-Tajik citizens on short notice. To enter this restricted zone, request a special permit from Tajik embassies/consulates or from the MFA Consular Department or the Department of Visas and Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (OVIR) registration department if applying within Tajikistan. Submit authorization requests at least two weeks in advance of your trip. If granted, authorities will annotate your passport with the names of the settlements and cities you are authorized to visit. If applying for an e-Visa for tourism, you can apply for official permission to visit GBAO at the same time, for an additional fee. Please visit the Republic of Tajikistan’s e-Visa Application webpage for information on electronic visas to Tajikistan and instructions for a GBAO permit. Border Areas with Kyrgyzstan: Exercise caution in areas near and along Tajikistan’s border with Kyrgyzstan. Several instances of clashes between Tajik and Kyrgyz citizens, as well as armed skirmishes involving border guards, have occurred, particularly in the Isfara and Vorukh districts. Unexploded Landmines and cluster munitions are a hazard along the Afghan-Tajik and Uzbek-Tajik borders, as well as in the Vakhsh and Rasht valleys. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked off with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions. Crime: Criminal activity in Dushanbe is moderate. Incidents are not usually violent, but muggings, armed robberies, and pick-pocketing do occur. Police do not provide adequate or immediate assistance and often will not open minor or routine cases. Other criminal activity, such as narcotics trafficking, can result in violence. Travel in pairs, especially at night. Sexual harassment of unaccompanied women is very common. Carry a copy of your passport (separate from your wallet) with you at all times. See the Department of State and the FBI webpages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of crime, including sexual assault and domestic violence, should contact the police or head to the nearest hospital to seek medical attention and report the crime. Please also contact the U.S. Embassy at (992)-37-229-2000. The local equivalent to the 911 emergency line in Tajikistan is 01 for fire, 02 for police, and 03 for ambulance service, and in Dushanbe, dial 235-4545 for the State Traffic Inspectorate (GAI) police for traffic accidents. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Replace a lost or stolen passport. Help you find appropriate medical care facilities. Put you in contact with appropriate police authorities. Contact relatives or friends with your written consent. Explain the local criminal justice process in general terms. Provide a list of local attorneys. Provide information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S. Tourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place in most locations. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is for the most part not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase traveler’s insurance for on-the-ground medical coverage as well as medical evacuation insurance . Demonstrations and Protests: Both are rare in Tajikistan; however, due to security reasons, U.S. citizens are advised not to participate.","Medical care is limited and significantly below U.S. standards, with severe shortages of basic medical supplies, including disposable needles, anesthetics, prescriptions drugs, and antibiotics. For emergency services in Tajikistan, dial 03 (103 from cell phone). Ambulance services are : Not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except in Dushanbe. Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

Thailand,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Periodic acts of violence in Thailand remain a concern. In August 2019, several small explosions and related arson events occurred in various locations throughout Bangkok resulting in no deaths but some injuries and minor property damage. Several small-scale bombings occurred near some tourist locations in the far Southern provinces in August 2016 and December 2018. In August 2015, an explosion near the Erawan Shrine in downtown Bangkok killed at least 20 people and injured more than 100. The U.S. Department of State assesses there is a continued risk of terrorism in Southeast Asia, including in Thailand. If a protest or demonstration is expected to pass near the U.S. Embassy or Consulate facilities, Embassy and Consulate entrances and functions may be restricted. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok’s website , Facebook, and Twitter sites and the U.S. Consulate General in Chiang Mai’s website , Facebook , and Twitter sites post information about local events that may affect Embassy functions. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program ( STEP ) to receive security and safety messages. Far Southern Thailand: Periodic violence directed mostly at Thai government interests by a domestic insurgency continues to affect security in the southernmost provinces of Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat, and Songkhla. U.S. citizens are at risk of death or injury due to the possibility of indiscriminate attacks in public places. Martial law is in force in this region. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these provinces. Travel to this region by U.S government employees must be reviewed and approved in advance. For more information on terrorist threats against U.S. citizens worldwide and steps to take as a result of these threats, please see the Worldwide Caution . Crime: Crimes of opportunity, such as pick-pocketing, bag-snatching, and burglary, occur in Thailand. Violent crimes against foreigners are relatively rare. However, murders, rapes, and assaults against foreigners do occur. Sexually motivated violence, committed by either Thai citizens or foreigners, is most likely to occur after time spent at bars, clubs, and parties, on beaches, or in remote/isolated areas. The Thai police response will differ from an investigation in the United States; investigating officials have publicly discredited people who have reported being the victim of crimes . In addition to making a report at the police jurisdiction in which the crime occurred, we advise contacting the Embassy and engaging a local attorney if you are a victim of an assault. When traveling alone, exercise caution, stay near other travelers, and ensure friends or family know how to contact you. Taxi and “tuk-tuk” drivers may attempt to charge excessive fares or refuse passengers. You should either request the driver use the meter or agree on the fare beforehand. At the airport use only public transportation from the airport’s official pick-up area, cars from the limousine counters, or a car from your hotel. Rental scams do occur in Thailand. Many rental motorbike, jet ski, and car companies will hold your passport until you pay for real or fictitious damages. We advise against using your passport as collateral. Exorbitant bar tab scams occur in Thailand. Some bars and entertainment venues will charge exorbitant prices for drinks or unadvertised cover charges and threaten violence if you don’t pay. Other scams involving gems, city tours, entertainment venues, and credit cards are common, especially in tourist areas. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Thailand. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Work permits/job offers Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of crime are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance.

Ambulance services are: not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except for Bangkok and other major cities. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. Medical treatment is generally adequate in Thailand’s urban areas. In Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket, and Pattaya, good facilities exist for routine, long-term, and emergency health care. Basic medical care is available in rural areas, but English-speaking providers are rare. Medical tourism is an established and rapidly growing industry.

In recent years the air quality in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Khon Kaen, Lampang, Nan, and Samut Sakhon have exceeded Thai and U.S. government daily standards for fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) for a portion of the year. In Chiang Mai and other northern provinces, annual agricultural burning, approximately February through late April, and forest fires cause days with unhealthy to hazardous air quality based on the U.S. index. In Bangkok environs, airborne dust and auto pollutants are prevalent in the cooler, dry period (December-February). Anyone who travels where pollution levels are high is at risk. People at the greatest risk from air pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens People over 65 years of age People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema; People with heart disease People who work or are active outdoors For Bangkok and Chiang Mai, U.S. Mission Thailand is reporting the U.S. EPA’s Air Quality Index (AQI) calculated from PM2.5 data captured by monitors owned and maintained by the Royal Thai Government.

Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery: Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on Medical Tourism. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Thailand. Although Thailand has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Thailand, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified. Pharmaceuticals: Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information.

Conditions at the Bangkok Immigration Detention Center (IDC): Conditions in immigration detention centers (IDCs) where authorities detain foreign nationals who violate immigration laws remain poor and most are overcrowded. IDCs, administered by the Immigration Police Bureau, which reports to the Royal Thai Police (RTP), are not subject to many of the regulations that govern the regular prison system. U.S. citizen detainees often complain of stark, austere living conditions, overcrowding, and unhealthy conditions. Personal security is poor. In addition, the main IDC in Bangkok does not dependably provide adequate medical or mental health care. In 2019, two U.S. citizens died while in custody at the Bangkok IDC. Deportations are self-funded and it may take up to two weeks for Thai authorities to process a case before deportation. Detainees must have funds to purchase a phone card and do not have access to the internet. Prior approval and a security escort are required to visit a Western Union or an ATM machine.

This is particularly true if you use a Gambian passport rather than a U.S. passport to enter The Gambia. Medications: Many common medications are available in Gambian pharmacies although you may need to know the European name or brand to find an equivalent product. Medication, such as insulin, requiring refrigeration may be difficult to store as The Gambia is subject to frequent power outages.

Accomplices who are aware of the practice but do not report it to the police can also be punished. Seventy five percent of girls and women have undergone FGM/C, with fifty six percent of girls undergoing this before the age of 15. Seven of the nine major ethnic groups practice FGM/C on girls from shortly after birth until age 16. See our travel tips for Women Travelers ."

Uganda,"In April 2019, a U.S. citizen was kidnapped in Queen Elizabeth National Park, in the southwest region of Uganda, near the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The U.S. citizen was later released unharmed. There is increased terrorist activity within the region. Recent events include the Ugandan Police Force reportedly foiling a planned bomb attack on churches by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Kampala; reported foiled plots of church attacks and subsequent explosive devices found in Kampala, and a fatal terror attack by ISIS-CA killing two international tourists and Ugandan driver within Queen Elizabeth National Park. Anyone can be a victim at any time; U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid large public gatherings. Communications plans are basic ways for people to ensure they can be reached while on travel or anywhere really. This includes having different types of communications (email, phone, satellite phone), letting people know when one will be in an area of cell coverage to receive messages, and providing phone numbers of the locations one will be staying etc. The State Department discusses this in the link here: https://exchanges.state.gov/us/keeping-touch . Northern and Eastern Uganda : The South Sudan-Uganda border is porous, and there are frequent reports of criminal trade and movement of people across the border. Due to the influx of refugees from South Sudan into Uganda, there is a strain on the region’s health, education, and security resources. Sporadic clashes may occur along the shared border, which may be poorly demarcated; a section is under dispute in the Moyo area of northwestern Uganda, abutting the Kajo Keji area of South Sudan. Crime and conflict threat in the Karamoja region in northeastern Uganda remain volatile. The Uganda People’s Defense Force actively engages criminals in the Karamoja Region, and armed confrontation between police and criminal elements can occur. Emergency medical care and auto repair services are lacking in remote areas of the Karamoja Region. The U.S. Embassy requires its employees to follow enhanced protocols when traversing the Karamoja region. Southwestern Uganda/Western Uganda : U.S. citizens traveling in southwestern Uganda along Uganda’s western border with the DRC should be aware that armed groups, including those aligned with terrorist organizations such as ISIS-CA, are active in eastern DRC, along with ongoing military operations to counter the threat in the region. Travelers should review the country information page and Travel Advisory for the DRC. Refugee flows across the border can number in the thousands, and there is a risk of incursions by armed combatants and criminals. There is a potential for violence related to ethnic and tribal tensions in the western districts of Bundibuguyo, Ntoroko, and Kasese, near the border with the DRC. U.S. citizens should be vigilant and monitor local media for the latest news. There is an uptick in terrorist activity in this specific region. Attacks in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Kasese,and Mpondwe-Lhubiriha have resulted in deaths of Ugandan as well as foreign nationals. The Governments of Rwanda and Uganda closed the Rwanda-Uganda border for extended periods of time in the last year. Some shutdowns are 24-hour closures and others are only overnight closures. Travelers should ensure the border is open when attempting to travel between Rwanda and Uganda. The U.S. Embassy requires its employees to follow enhanced protocols when traversing the region from Lake Albert down to the Rwandan border. The U.S. State Department encourages overseas travelers to develop communication plans to ensure they can be reached while traveling.

Involvement in Local Social Issues : All U.S. citizen travelers to Uganda should ensure that they have the correct visa for their visit to Uganda.

Local authorities have been known to detain, question, and arrest foreigners in Uganda, and some visitors have been ordered removed from the country. Crime : Pick pocketing, purse snatching, and thefts from hotel rooms, parked vehicles, and vehicles stalled in traffic jams are common.

Assaults and property snatching by boda boda (motorcycle operators and passengers) are routinely reported. Food and drinks should never be left unattended in public. Women have reported being drugged and taken to another location and sexually assaulted. Similar tactics are used to rob individuals on public transportation. Remain with a group of friends in public, as single individuals are more likely to be targeted. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Uganda. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters.

Individuals or organizations viewed as publicly supporting the dignity and human rights of LGBTQI+ persons could be prosecuted and imprisoned for multi-year sentence, including those that attend a same-sex marriage either inside or outside of Uganda’s borders. LGBTQI+ organizations or those that advocate for the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons may be deemed illegal under the law. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights Report for further details. Importation of Healthcare Products : Individuals and organizations seeking to bring or import healthcare products, including medicines and medical devices, are responsible for ensuring the importation is in accordance with the Uganda National Drug Policy and Authority Act. This includes donated products intended to support medical assistance efforts. The importation of expired products is prohibited, and many products require a market authorization issued by the Uganda National Drug Authority to be legally imported. Prohibited items are subject to seizure and importers can face criminal and civil action. Inquiries and applications for import authorizations should be sent to the Uganda National Drug Authority via ndaug@nda.or.ug ."
Ukraine,"Terrorism Activity: Credible information indicates that terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Small-scale bombings continue to occur throughout Ukraine. While most attacks are at night and appear intended to cause property damage and incite fear, multiple attacks within the past year have been fatal, sometimes occurring in populated areas during daylight hours. Please read the Travel Advisory for Ukraine before traveling. While in Ukraine, you should carry travel documents with you at all times. Potential for civil disturbances: Large-scale protests have occurred from time to time in cities throughout Ukraine. You should avoid large gatherings or protests and adjacent areas. In the past, some protests have turned violent and resulted in deaths and injuries. Be alert and aware of your surroundings and pay attention to local news media. The Embassy will post information about sizeable planned protests on the Embassy website . Crimea: There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in Crimea as part of Russia’s occupation and attempted annexation of this part of Ukraine, which the international community, including the United States and Ukraine, does not recognize. There are continuing abuses against and arbitrary imprisonment of foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in Crimea, particularly abuses against individuals who are seen as challenging Russian authority on the peninsula. The U.S. government prohibits employees from traveling to Crimea and is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens there. Eastern Ukraine : U.S. citizens should not travel to the eastern parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts due to ongoing armed conflict. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in this area. U.S. citizens have been specifically targeted by gunmen representing the self-proclaimed authorities and threatened, detained, or kidnapped for hours or days. Shortages of water, power, medicine, and food supplies have also been reported in Russian-proxy-controlled territory, and widespread disorder and looting has been confirmed in these areas. Crime: Criminals may target tourists due to perceived wealth. A new professional and well-trained police force (Patrol Police) has been implemented, but police corruption remains an issue. Criminal activity, including burglaries, robberies, muggings, and pickpocketing is increasingly a problem in Ukraine. Law enforcement and emergency officials rarely speak English, and interpreters are not readily available. Muggings, attacks, armed robberies, harassment, or the drugging at nightspots of unsuspecting victims (who are then robbed and/or assaulted) have been reported. Cases of assaults in apartment building corridors, elevators, and stairwells, as well as armed break-ins and crimes involving firearms, have also been reported. Recently, there has been an increase in reports of criminals luring unsuspecting visitors to Ukraine with promises of cheap lodging and/or companionship. The criminals then forcibly abduct the visitors and proceed to make unauthorized transactions via their victims’ bank cards and accounts. Many incidents of criminal activity occur on the public transport system, including the metro. When riding on public transportation or moving in crowded areas, keep your purse, bag, or backpack tightly under your arm and/or in front of your body. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victim of sexual assault should report crimes to the local police at 102 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +38 (044) 521-5000 after hours. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .

The Embassy will be able to assist with contacting police and provide you with a list of local shelters. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not occur everywhere. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally able to access areas outside of major cities and to provide necessary medical treatment, but it may take time for them to arrive. Local law requires foreigners to have medical insurance when traveling to Ukraine. U.S. citizens are encouraged to consider purchasing additional medical evacuation insurance when arranging their medical insurance for traveling to Ukraine.","By Ukrainian law, all foreigners coming to Ukraine must have medical insurance covering their period of travel. Note that the general quality of healthcare in Ukraine does not meet U.S. standards. Fees at government clinics and hospitals are lower than those at private clinics, but there have been reports that doctors request bribes or additional payments before treating patients. Private physicians and private hospitals charge fees for services, and some do not accept local health insurance. Public facilities only accept cash payments, while most private clinics accept credit cards. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. See our webpage for more information on insurance overseas. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas . We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Medication: If traveling with prescription medication, check with the State Register of Medicines (Ukrainian language only) to ensure the medication is legal to bring into the country, as many medications that are legal in the United States are prohibited in Ukraine. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. The following diseases are prevalent in Ukraine: Influenza Tuberculosis Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Further health information: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. If you are arrested, you can face extended periods, even years, in pre-trial detention. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs are severe, and if convicted you can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Furthermore, some violations of laws in Ukraine are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrests: When in a foreign country, you are subject the country’s laws. If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information. Ukrainian law permits police to stop you for any reason and check your identification documents. You are required to carry your passport at all times; police may check to verify your legal presence in Ukraine. Police are permitted to detain you for up to 72 hours without formal charges. If stopped by the police for an unclear reason, call the U.S. Embassy at +38 (044) 521 5000. Faith-Based Travelers: See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report and the following webpages for details Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTI Travelers: Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is a problem in Ukraine, as LGBTI individuals have been the target of harassment, threats, and acts of violence.

See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section six of our Human Rights Report for further details. Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Accessibility is an issue in Ukraine. Public transport systems are not fully accessible to individuals with disabilities. Some newer buildings feature ramps and elevators, but older buildings do not. You should check ahead with your hotel/destination to learn more about options to accommodate disabled traveler needs before visiting Ukraine. See our Traveling with Disabilities page.

United Arab Emirates,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) U.S. citizens in the United Arab Emirates should exercise a high level of security awareness. The possibility of terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens and interests in the Gulf and Arabian Peninsula remains a serious concern. The UAE’s normalization of relations with Israel in September 2020 increased the potential for attacks in the UAE, including by Iran-backed entities. Separately, rebel groups operating in Yemen have stated an intent to attack neighboring countries, including the UAE, using missiles and unmanned aerial systems (drones). Yemen-based Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for missile and drone attacks against the UAE on January 17 and 24, 2022, targeting populated areas and civilian infrastructure.  The January 17 attack resulted in multiple impact sites in Abu Dhabi and three fatalities. The Houthi rebels have publicly stated their intent to continue such attacks. In the event of a missile and/or drone strike, follow the guidance found here . Both historical and current information suggest that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), al-Qaida, and affiliated organizations continue to plan attacks against Western targets; these attacks may employ a wide variety of tactics, including suicide operations, assassination, kidnapping, hijacking, and bombing. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Boating: The UAE and Iran have had a long-standing dispute concerning jurisdiction of Abu Musa, approximately 20 miles from Dubai. Fishing or sailing in these waters may result in seizure of vessels and detention of passengers and crew in Iran. Obtaining consular assistance in Iran for U.S. citizens is difficult and can only be done through the Swiss Embassy in Tehran , which acts as a Protecting Power, providing limited U.S. consular services. Crime: Violent crimes and crimes against property are rare. U.S. citizens should take the same security precautions in the UAE that one would practice in the United States or any large city abroad. Harassment and Assault: U.S. citizens, especially women, should take precautions against the possibility of verbal and physical harassment or sexual assault when walking alone, consuming alcohol, or riding in a taxi cab. Taxi passengers should avoid sitting in the front seat of a taxicab and should be sensitive that ""small talk"" can be misinterpreted as over-friendliness or even a form of propositioning by some taxi drivers. Taxis driven by women for the exclusive use of female passengers are available in some airports and by dispatch. Female travelers can identify these dedicated vehicles by their pink roofs. Some victims of sexual assault have been prosecuted for violating laws against sexual relations outside of marriage. The law puts a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that sex was not consensual. In cases where the victim has failed to demonstrate so, both parties have been prosecuted, and sometimes sentenced to jail time, followed by deportation. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in the UAE. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 999 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +971 2 414 2200. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or Consulate General for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance .","Adequate health facilities are available, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. While most common conditions can be appropriately treated in the UAE, complex medical conditions may be better treated in the United States. Providers may recommend a large number of procedures and tests, some of which may be unnecessary. Hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient, except in emergencies. Travelers should make efforts to obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. For emergency services in the UAE, dial 999 . Ambulance services are widely available. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. You may be denied care, even in an emergency, if you are unable to provide a cash deposit up-front. See our webpage for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Medication: Many prescription and over-the-counter medications are prohibited in the UAE, and possession of such substances without the appropriate approval is generally treated the same as possession of illegal narcotics. All tourists and residents of the UAE should seek prior approval, via an online form, before carrying certain types of medications, narcotics, or chemical substances to or through the UAE. The service can be accessed directly on the Ministry of Health and Prevention’s website . Travelers can also find updated lists of prohibited medications requiring prior approval on the same website. Travelers with prescription medication must have their prescriptions issued by licensed doctors and authenticated by the appropriate authorities. In order for a U.S. prescription to be fully authenticated, it must be authenticated by the Secretary of State of the U.S. state in which the prescribing doctor is licensed, then by the U.S. Department of State, and finally by the UAE Embassy in Washington, DC. Additional information on authentication of documents can be found on the State Department’s website and on the Embassy and Consulate General website . Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Further queries may be directed to the UAE Ministry of Health’s Drug Control Department in Abu Dhabi. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For further health information, go to: World Health Organization U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Air Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. Air pollution is a significant problem in UAE. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you, and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: Infants, children, and teens People over 65 years of age People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema; People with heart disease or diabetes People who work or are active outdoors The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General maintain a list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. As each emirate has its own independent judicial system, legal procedures and penalties vary throughout the country. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: UAE authorities do not routinely notify the U.S. Embassy or consulate of a U.S. citizen’s arrest.  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or consulate immediately.  If you are not allowed to do so, ask a friend or family member to contact the U.S. Embassy or consulate. See our webpage for further information. Alcohol: Alcohol is sold only in very limited areas including certain restaurants and hotels. Public drunkenness and driving under the influence, regardless of one’s blood alcohol content level, are considered very serious offenses. Persons arrested on alcohol-related offenses are regularly detained for many days as they await a court hearing. Penalties may include hefty jail sentences, substantial fines and, for Muslims (even those holding U.S. citizenship), lashings. Note: The possession and consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the emirate of Sharjah. Drugs: UAE law imposes the death sentence for convicted drug traffickers. Possession of even trace amounts of illegal drugs (including in the bloodstream) can result in lengthy prison sentences of up to 15 years. Bail generally is not granted to those accused of drug crimes. Possession or consumption of marijuana in any form, including detections of trace amounts in the bloodstream, is illegal in the UAE, even if a doctor’s medical card is presented. Products containing cannabidiol (CBD) are illegal in the UAE. Possession or importation of CBD products, including those found in prescription and over the counter medications in the United States and other countries, are prosecuted in the same manner as marijuana possession. The UAE's anti-narcotics program also includes poppy seeds on its list of controlled substances. The importation and possession of poppy seeds in any and all forms, including as dried decorative plants, are strictly prohibited. Persons may be charged and convicted even if the controlled substances were ingested outside of the UAE as long as traces are still present in the bloodstream upon arrival in the UAE. If suspected of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, individuals may be required to submit to blood and/or urine tests and may be subject to prosecution. Travelers with questions regarding the items on the list of controlled substances should contact the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi or the U.S. Consulate General in Dubai . Codes of Behavior and Dress: Public decency and morality laws throughout the UAE are much stricter than in the United States. Penalties for public displays of affection or immodesty may be imposed. Sexual relations outside marriage are illegal in the UAE and convicted individuals have been punished by lengthy jail sentences. Pregnancy outside of marriage can result in arrest and detention. Doctors may ask for proof of marriage during pre-natal visits, and those giving birth in the UAE must present a marriage certificate to receive medical care and register the child’s birth. Failure to do so has resulted in the arrests of both unmarried mothers and fathers, as well as deportation. Individuals may be arrested, fined, and/or deported for committing any of the following acts: making rude gestures, swearing, touching another person without his/her permission, and making derogatory statements about the UAE, the royal families, the local governments or other people. Travelers should keep in mind the cultural differences among the many people who coexist in the UAE and should be cognizant that unwitting actions, including clothing choices, may invite unwanted attention. Debt and Financial Crime: Crimes of financial fraud, including passing bad checks and non-payment or late payment of bills (including hotel bills, hospital bills, traffic or parking fines, and late payment of credit cards, utility bills, etc.), are regarded seriously in the UAE and often result in imprisonment and/or fines. A personal check written as a guarantee for the payment of a personal or business debt may be submitted to a local bank for collection at any time for the full amount of the check. If the account holder does not have sufficient funds, he/she may be charged with passing a bad check. Bail generally is not available to non-residents of the UAE who are arrested for crimes involving fraud. Debtors can be held in prison until their debts are paid or until an agreement is reached between the parties. Passports may be seized by the UAE government to guarantee that debtors settle their cases. Financial cases may be further complicated by debtors being unable to work in the UAE without passports while still being held responsible for their debts. Photography: Taking photographs of UAE military facilities, sensitive civilian sites, airports, some beaches, or foreign diplomatic missions – including the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General – may result in arrest, detention, and/or prosecution by local authorities. Travelers should be aware of signs which indicate where photography is prohibited. Note that it is illegal to take photographs of other people without their consent. In addition, engaging in mapping activities, especially mapping that includes the use of GPS equipment, without coordination with UAE authorities, may have the same consequences. (This does not apply to use of publicly available online maps.) Drone Operation: The flying of drones is prohibited in certain areas and may result in arrest and imprisonment. Individuals should not operate drones without prior approval from local authorities. Social Media: The UAE has strict laws regarding use of the internet and social media. Individuals have been arrested and criminally convicted for posting information on social media sites (such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.) that local authorities determined was disturbing to the order of the UAE. Users of social media should be cautious about online posting of information that might be deemed to insult or challenge the local or national government. Individuals should avoid posting insults or derogatory information about governments, institutions, or individuals. Charity and fundraising activities are closely regulated by the UAE government, and it is against the law to conduct any private fundraising activity online (including those conducted on popular fundraising websites for personal causes). The UAE National Media Council has rules for conducting business as a social media influencer in the UAE. Influencers must apply for trade and e-media licenses in order to promote brands on social media in the UAE. Terrorist Organizations List: On November 15, 2014, the UAE government announced a list of 85 groups it considers to be terrorist organizations. Individuals who are associated with groups on the UAE list could be detained at UAE borders, have their assets frozen, and/or be prosecuted for membership in a terrorist organization. Religious Proselytizing: While individuals are free to worship as they choose, and facilities are available for that purpose, religious proselytizing is not permitted in the UAE. Persons violating this law, even unknowingly, may be imprisoned or deported. Employment in the UAE: Although it is common for a local sponsor to hold an employee's passport, it is illegal to do so under UAE law. Many contractual or labor disputes can be avoided by clearly establishing all terms and conditions of employment or sponsorship in the labor contract at the beginning of any employment. Should a dispute arise, the UAE Ministry of Labor has established a special department to review and arbitrate labor claims. If an employee leaves his/her job without properly canceling the employment visa, the employer can file charges that can lead to imprisonment, fines, and/or deportation. The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General do not intercede in employment disputes. U.S. citizens have become involved in commercial or financial disputes that have prompted local firms or courts to take possession of the U.S. citizen's passport, effectively preventing the individual from leaving the UAE. In addition, local firms have been known to file criminal complaints, which may lead not only to travel restrictions but possible criminal penalties, including jail time. A list of local attorneys is available from the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the U.S. Consulate General in Dubai. Document Authentications: U.S. citizens intending to reside and work in the UAE are generally required by the UAE government to present authenticated personal documents for themselves and accompanying family members such as marriage and birth certificates, adoption and custody decrees, certificates of good behavior from police, and educational documents to include diplomas and certificates. The authentication of U.S. documents is done completely in the United States. For information, contact the State Department’s Office of Authentications . Determining the exact requirements with one’s prospective employer is strongly recommended before arrival in the UAE. LGBTQI+ Travelers: The UAE government does not accept passports with the “X” gender marker. This applies to travel to, in, or through the UAE. Although the U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulate General are not aware of any recent arrests or prosecutions for consensual, same-sex relations and cross-dressing, they remain illegal in the UAE. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section six of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: While in the UAE, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodations somewhat different from what they find in the United States. The law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, air travel and other transportation, access to health care, or the provision of other state services, and the law is enforced. The UAE government refers to persons with disabilities as “people of determination.” Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication/access to services/ease of movement or access. The UAE has several modern cities with good services and accessibility of lodging, public transportation, sidewalks, and buildings. Outside of newly constructed areas, accessibility is not comparable to the United States and navigating with a visual impairment or using a wheelchair is difficult due to sidewalks in disrepair or without curb cuts, poor road crossings, and inaccessible buildings and public transport. Public transportation in Dubai is wheelchair accessible. However, the buses that connect Dubai with the other emirates in the UAE are not wheelchair accessible. See the UAE government information on accessible transport and parking facilities. See our Traveling with Disabilities page. Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers .

United Kingdom,"Terrorist groups continue plotting possible near-term attacks in Europe. The UK Security Service publishes specific reasons for any changes in the threat level and recommended actions for the public via its UK threat levels website . There is the potential for isolated violence related to the political situation in Northern Ireland. The Police Service of Northern Ireland assesses there is a continued threat of violence from dissident groups in Northern Ireland, focused primarily on police and military targets, and may involve the use of firearms and explosives . Tensions may be heightened during the summer marching season (April to August), particularly on and around the July 12 public holiday. Avoid areas of demonstrations if possible, and be careful within the vicinity of demonstrations. Demonstrations occur frequently in and around city centers and areas where tourists frequent. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly escalate to violence. The phone number for police/fire/ambulance emergency services is 999 in the United Kingdom and 112 in Gibraltar. You should also use these numbers to report security threats or suspicious packages. Also see information for contacting police from abroad . Crime : Be cautious and aware of your surroundings. Be vigilant, as pickpocketing , mugging, and “snatch and grab” theft of mobile phones, watches and jewelry can occur. Do not leave bags unattended in restaurants, pubs, hotel lobbies, and parked cars. Be alert to other criminal schemes, such as impostors posing as undercover police officers and “fining” tourists for bogus minor offenses. A legitimate Metropolitan Police Services officer will never demand an immediate cash payment. Use only licensed Black Cabs or pre-ordered car services (minicabs) . Unlicensed taxis or private cars posing as taxis may offer low fares, but in some instances, travelers have been robbed or sexually assaulted while using these cars. See Transport for London for additional information on cabs and car services . Avoid using ATMs that look temporary in structure or location or are located in isolated areas – they may not be legitimate. Use ATMs located inside a bank branch.

Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: UK law requires that all public service providers (except in the transportation sector) make “reasonable adjustments” to ensure their services are available to persons with disabilities. Nevertheless, code exemptions permit many older buildings to have steps up from the street. Getting around in cities may be difficult at times because sidewalks can be narrow and uneven. Most London Underground and UK National Rail System stations are not readily accessible for people with disabilities. Many stations do not have elevators, and have stairways and long corridors for changing trains or exiting to the street. Many UK buses are equipped with lowering platforms for limited-mobility or sight- or hearing-disabled travelers. Many taxis have swivel-entry seats or retractable ramps to ease entry. Disabled parking permits (known as “blue badges”) are issued by local government councils throughout the country. Visit the UK government website for contact information. Some councils may not offer permits to temporary visitors. The Transport for London and National Rail websites provide information for passengers with disabilities.

Uruguay,"Crime: The volume of crimes against persons and property, to include homicides, is high throughout Uruguay. Street crime, including armed robberies, theft and carjackings occur in tourist centers within Montevideo with large numbers of tourists, such as Ciudad Vieja, the Rambla, and the neighborhood around the U.S. Embassy. Even upscale residential neighborhoods, such as Punta Carretas, Pocitos, and Carrasco are not immune to criminal activity. Maintain situational awareness and practice good personal security at all times while traveling throughout Uruguay as criminals typically seek out victims in vulnerable situations. Thefts, burglaries, armed robberies, assaults, and other violent crimes are common throughout Uruguay. Criminals tend to conduct surveillance on potential targets including ATMs, residences, restaurants, vehicles, and individuals prior to committing robberies. Criminals regularly travel in pairs on motorcycles to approach unsuspecting victims with a weapon and demand personal belongings before fleeing. They attempt to catch victims off-guard by driving slowly next to their vehicles and waiting for them to get out of their car to rob them. Other times, they break car windows to steal valuables from vehicles that are parked or stuck in traffic. Be vigilant when using ATMs, especially during non-daylight hours. Criminals frequently use gas-induced explosive devices to steal from ATMs. The following Montevideo neighborhoods have higher crime rates, and official U.S. government personnel are recommended to avoid or limit travel to these areas: 40 Semanas Bella Italia Borro Casavalle Casabó Cerro Cerro Norte Hipódromo La Teja Marconi Malvín Norte Tres Ombúes Villa Española During the summer months (December-March), many cities in Uruguay experience an increase of petty street crime, residential burglaries, and robberies, especially in beach towns such as Punta del Este, La Barra, La Paloma, Cabo Polonio, La Pedrera, and Punta del Diablo. Criminals also target vehicles traveling to these and other popular destinations. Police cars are clearly marked and equipped with cellular phones. While professional and well-trained, local police do not maintain a robust physical presence to deter criminal activity throughout Montevideo, which often results in a delayed response. Most police officers do not speak English. Demonstrations: Demonstrations, some expressing anti-U.S. sentiment, regularly occur in Uruguay, particularly near the Legislative Palace, City Hall, Parque Batlle, Plaza Libertad, and the universities in Montevideo. Protests directed toward the U.S. government, usually small in size, can occur around the U.S. Embassy. U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Uruguay should avoid large gatherings or events where crowds congregate to demonstrate, protest, or cause damage as a byproduct of celebrating an event, such as after soccer matches. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (598) 1770-2000 or MontevideoACS@state.gov .

The responsiveness of emergency, personal ambulance service is generally within U.S. standards; however there may be service delays if questions about health insurance coverage arise. Ambulances are staffed with a medical doctor, enabling advanced treatment/care en route to the local hospital. The U.S. Government does not pay medical bills, and U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Serious medical problems requiring hospitalization and/or medical evacuation to the United States can cost tens of thousands of dollars.

Uzbekistan,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists. Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Demonstrations are rare and unlikely to occur, particularly inside Tashkent. However, clashes between police and protesters have resulted in deaths in the past. Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. Past demonstrations have ended in mass arrests. Check local and/or social media for updates and traffic advisories. Violent demonstrations may be more likely outside the capital city. Crime: Violent crime against foreign nationals is rare, but can occur, especially in larger cities and primarily during late night hours. In urban areas, travelers are urged to take the same precautions they would take in any large U.S. city. If traveling at night, stay in well-lit areas, travel in groups, maintain a low profile, and do not display large amounts of cash. Beware of pickpockets in public places, such as tourist destinations, train stations, and local markets. Although using private cars as taxis is common in Uzbekistan, U.S. citizens, especially women, should not consider this a safe practice. U.S. citizens are encouraged to use clearly marked taxis, such as those at hotels, and should avoid riding in unmarked taxis.

Recreational Diving: Diving in Vanuatu has the potential to be dangerous. We suggest the following tips for visitors who plan to dive while in Vanuatu: Verify that your dive operator is currently certified through one of the international diving associations (PADI, NAUI, BSAC, CMAS, etc.). Ensure that rental equipment is in good working condition, with up-to-date inspection stamps. Make sure your equipment fits properly. Postpone or cancel diving activity if any equipment is faulty. Try to remain in pairs or in a group that includes a dive guide. Determine your level of training before engaging in deep water or wreck dives. Confirm that dive operators have adequate onsite emergency equipment and diver-recall systems. Know that the nearest hyperbaric chamber might be hours away, or require a plane flight. There is one hyperbaric facility in Port Vila, Vanuatu, far from some of the more remote dive sites. Due to the high costs for decompression services and associated emergency transportation, divers are strongly advised to obtain adequate medical evacuation and diver’s insurance. Please report any unsafe conditions or diving practices to either the certifying diving association or the local authorities. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips .

Venezuela,"Terrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Terrorist groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia – People’s Army (FARC-EP), Segunda Marquetalia, and the Colombian-origin National Liberation Army (ELN) have expanded in Venezuela in recent years.  We are aware of reports of cooperation between FARC dissidents and the ELN in the areas of road/border checkpoints, forced displacement of communities, and narcotics trafficking. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Violent crime is pervasive throughout Venezuela.  Venezuela has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, and kidnappings are a serious concern.  Be alert of your surroundings at all times and take personal security precautions to avoid becoming a victim of crime.  Maintain a low profile, travel in groups of five or more, and provide family or friends with your itineraries prior to departure. Avoid police activity.  Corruption within the police forces is a concern, and criminals may be posing as police officers or National Guard members.  National Guard members may target U.S. citizens, especially at remote land border crossings, for bribery, extortion, or detention, possibly in collusion with criminal organizations. Criminal gangs operate openly and with little repercussion, often setting up fake police checkpoints.  Armed robberies, including with grenades and assault rifles, take place throughout the country, including in tourist areas and institutions such as banks and ATMs, national parks, shopping malls, public transportation stations, and universities. Drugs: Do not attempt to bring any narcotics or controlled substances into Venezuela, or substances that may be confused with illegal drugs.  Do not accept packages from anyone and always keep your luggage with you.  U.S. citizens have been actively recruited to act as narcotics couriers or “drug mules.”  Arrestees can expect extended jail terms under extremely difficult prison conditions. Transportation: Do not use any taxis hailed on the street.  Some taxi drivers in Caracas are known to overcharge, rob, injure, and even kidnap passengers.  Use only radio-dispatched taxis from taxi services, hotels, restaurants, and airline staff.  Do not use public transportation such as city buses and the metro (subway) in Caracas.  If you drive, be aware of attacks in tunnels and avoid obstacles in the road. Maiquetía International Airport: Only travel to and from Maiquetía International Airport near Caracas in daylight hours.  Kidnappings, robberies at gunpoint, thefts, and muggings are common.  Do not pack valuable items or documents in checked luggage.  Individuals wearing seemingly official uniforms and displaying airport or police credentials have been involved in crimes inside the airport, including extortion and robberies.  Make advance plans for transportation from the airport to your hotel or destination using a trusted party or dispatch taxi service. ATMs: Most ATMs do not accept U.S. debit or credit cards, and malfunctions are common.  Use only those located in well-lit, public places.  ATM data is often hacked and used to make unauthorized withdrawals.  Criminals target ATM users for robberies.  Many ATMs do not have cash. Demonstrations occur occasionally.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Venezuela.  Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters.  Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.  Common scams include: Romance/online dating Money transfers Grandparent/relative targeting Victims of Crime: The U.S. government has extremely limited means of providing consular services to U.S. citizen crime victims in Venezuela.  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Bogota.  Report crimes to the local police at 171, and contact the U.S. Embassy in Bogota by emailing ACSBogota@state.gov or dialing +57 (1) 275-2000 or +57 (1) 275-4021 after hours.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

Colombian Border: The area within a 50-mile radius along the entire Venezuela and Colombian border is extremely dangerous.  U.S. citizens near the border are at risk of detention by Maduro regime authorities.  U.S. citizens must obtain a visa to enter Venezuela legally.  Visas are not available upon arrival.  U.S. citizens attempting to enter Venezuela without a visa have been charged with terrorism and other serious crimes and detained for long periods.  The Maduro regime does not notify the U.S. government of the detention of U.S. citizens and the U.S. government is not granted access to those citizens.  Additionally, cross-border violence, kidnapping, drug trafficking, and smuggling are common.  Some kidnapping victims are released after ransom payments, while others are murdered.  Do not attempt to cross the land border. Tourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place on any level.  Tourists participate in activities at their own risk.  Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . Serious medical issues require costly medical evacuation complicated by restrictions on air travel to and from Venezuela.  Air evacuations to the United States from Venezuela may not be possible.","All air passengers entering Venezuela must present a certificate of vaccination against COVID-19 (completed vaccination schedule) in either physical or digital format (with QR code), with the last dose administered at least 14 days prior to the entry date in Venezuela.  If more than 270 days has passed since the last dose of a completed vaccination schedule, proof of a booster dose is required.  In lieu of proof of vaccination, passengers must present a negative PCR-RT COVID-19 test result, taken within 72 hours of arriving.  Please visit the U.S. Embassy’s COVID-19 page for more information on COVID-19 in Venezuela. For emergency services in Venezuela, dial 171. Ambulance services are: not widely available, depending on the individual’s health insurance, and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. unreliable in most areas. not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. Emergency medical evacuation flights between the United States and Venezuela may not be possible. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.  Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on types of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Before travelling to Venezuela with prescription medications, travelers should research current Customs and Immigration restrictions in place at Venezuelan ports of entry. Vaccinations: Be up to date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  A Yellow Fever vaccination is required if coming from or transiting for more than 12 hours through Brazil.  Carry your International Certificate of Vaccination (or yellow card) with you upon arrival. Health Facilities in General: Do not depend on health care facilities in Venezuela for medical care. Serious medical issues require costly medical evacuation complicated by restrictions on air travel to and from Venezuela.  Air evacuations to the United States may not be possible. Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies, including soap and water.  In recent years, hospital infrastructure has deteriorated significantly, and medical staff are in short supply.  Patients frequently must supply their own water, medication, and medical instruments to receive care. Adequate private health facilities are available in Caracas and other major cities, but health care in rural areas is well below U.S. standards.  Many private hospitals and clinics are increasingly overcrowded and experience shortages of public utilities such as electricity and running water. Some private hospitals and doctors require cash payment “up front” prior to service or admission.  Credit card payment and online transfers are sometimes available.  If you cannot provide an up-front payment, you may be referred to a public institution. Medical staff may speak little to no English. Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight.  Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child. Patients may be required to bear costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities. Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for information on medical tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Venezuela. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Venezuela. Pharmaceuticals: Some medical supplies are unavailable in Venezuela, and you should not expect to find all necessary medications in Venezuela.  Travelers should carry over the counter and prescription drugs sufficient to cover the entire duration of their trips. Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas.  Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls.  Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients.  Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States.  Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States.  Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States.  Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information. Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy If you are considering traveling to Venezuela to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our ART and Surrogacy Abroad page . There is no legal framework for foreigners or same-sex couples to pursue surrogacy in Venezuela.  According to Venezuelan law, the birth mother of a child born in Venezuela is the legal mother.  Surrogacy agreements between foreign or same sex intending parents and gestational mothers are not enforced by Venezuelan courts. If you decide to pursue parenthood in Venezuela via assisted reproductive technology (ART) with a gestational mother, be prepared for long and unexpected delays in documenting your child’s citizenship.  Be aware that individuals who attempt to circumvent local law risk criminal prosecution. Water Quality: Tap water is not potable, even in major cities.  Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested.  Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Expect frequent shortages in running water. Gastrointestinal illnesses such as severe diarrhea are common throughout the country. Adventure Travel Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel . General Health The following diseases are prevalent: COVID-19 Dengue Zika Chikungunya Chagas Disease (Trypanosomiasis) Measles (Rubeloa) Malaria Leishmaniasis Schistosomiasis (Bilharzia) Travelers’ Diarrhea Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.  Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in Venezuela.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws.  If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.  Application of local laws can at times be arbitrary and/or politically motivated. In Venezuela, it is illegal to take pictures of sensitive buildings, including the presidential palace, military bases, government buildings, and airports. Drug trafficking is a serious problem in Venezuela and treated as such by Venezuelan authorities.  Convicted traffickers receive lengthy prison sentences. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, attempt to have someone notify the U.S. Embassy in Bogota immediately.  See our webpage for further information. Please note that the U.S. Department of State may not be informed of your detention, particularly if you also hold Venezuelan citizenship.  Due to the suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, consular visits to detained U.S. citizens are not possible. There have been instances of U.S. citizens in recent years who have been detained without being afforded due process or fair trial guarantees, or as a pretext for an illegitimate purpose, often due to their U.S. citizenship. Currency and Exchange: Venezuela has started to allow dollarized commercial transactions and shopping, but policies and availability are subject to change.  Some local businesses accept U.S. credit cards and electronic transfers through certain online vendors.  “Black market” currency exchanges – often offering significantly favorable exchange rates – are technically prohibited under Venezuelan foreign exchange controls.  Violators may be detained by Venezuelan authorities and face criminal penalties. Wire Transfers: Wire transfers cannot be used reliably as a source of emergency funds, and receipt of funds is generally restricted to Venezuelan citizens and residents. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws.  You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States.  See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Faith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details: Faith-Based Travel Information International Religious Freedom Report – see country reports Human Rights Report – see country reports Hajj Fact Sheet for Travelers Best Practices for Volunteering Abroad LGBTQI+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTIQ+ events in Venezuela. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Travelers with Disabilities: The law in Venezuela prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.  Accessibility is more prevalent in the capital city of Caracas than in the rest of the country. The availability of rental, repair, and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices as well as service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants, is limited.

Vietnam,"The Department of State recommends that U.S. citizens overseas always maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness while traveling internationally. Please visit www.travel.state.gov for up-to-date information. Messages regarding weather-related events are posted here and on the Embassy/Consulate General website . While in Vietnam you are subject to Vietnamese laws. U.S. citizenship will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, expelled, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Vietnamese authorities routinely do not provide timely notification of the arrest of a U.S. citizen to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General or approval for consular officials to visit U.S. citizens. The delays for both – particularly for access – can take several weeks. Note that if you enter Vietnam with a non-U.S. passport, the Government of Vietnam has different notification and access responsibilities for the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General. See our webpage for further information. Small-scale, peaceful protests occasionally occur in Vietnam’s major cities, but large-scale demonstrations are rare. As in any country, you should avoid large protests, as they can become violent with little or no warning. The Government of Vietnam may not allow or authorize travel to certain areas of the country that are deemed sensitive. Check with local authorities before visiting border areas to see if you need to obtain a travel permit issued by local authorities. U.S. citizens have been detained after traveling in areas close to the Vietnamese borders with the People’s Republic of China, Cambodia, and Laos. These areas are not always marked, and there are no warnings about prohibited travel. Safety standards in Vietnam are not at the same level as those in the United States and vary greatly from company to company and province to province. This is especially true for fire safety codes. Travelers should be aware that many buildings, including hotels, shops, and restaurants, have limited or no fire safety equipment or emergency exits. Ground and water transportation also lack safety regulations. Travelers to Vietnam should have no expectation of privacy and should safeguard all personal documents and electronic devices. Exercise caution when discussing sensitive or proprietary information. Crime: Crime in Vietnam is rated high. Exercise vigilance and the same commonsense security precautions you would in any major metropolitan city in the United States. Violent crime against foreigners is rare; however, petty crimes, such as theft, bag grabs, and pickpocketing occur regularly, especially in crowded areas and tourist locations. Typically, there is a rise in petty crime during the Christmas and Tet (Lunar New Year) holiday seasons, including during the day and in well-lit areas. Motorcyclists are known to snatch bags, cameras, cell phones, and other valuables from individuals riding or walking on the street. If you are targeted by thieves, do not resist, and report the incident immediately to local police and to the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi or the U.S. Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City. Keep a tight hold on bags as you enter and exit vehicles and as you walk around. Hold tightly to cell phones when using them outside and lock and stow phones until you actually need to use them. Some U.S. citizens have reported threats of death or physical injury connected to business-related disputes. You should report such threats to local authorities and if you feel unsafe, you should depart the country. Keep your passport and other important valuables in your hotel in a safe or another secured location at all times and carry both photo and digital copies of your passport. You should immediately report the loss or theft of your U.S. passport to the local police and the U.S. Embassy or the U.S. Consulate General. See section on “Visas” for information on what to do if your passport/visa are lost or stolen. Sexual Assault: Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Sexual assault, harassment and rape do occur. To minimize the risk avoid travelling alone, especially at night; remain particularly vigilant in less populous areas; and be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances. Local authorities may not always respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment. If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to local authorities and to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Male violence against women and sexual harassment is often ignored by the police. In areas foreigners frequent, women have reported harassment and assault such as men exposing themselves, asking for sexual favors, and groping. Drugs: Recreational drugs available in Vietnam can be extremely dangerous and can result in death. Drugs sold in Vietnam may be fake, synthetic, or laced with toxic ingredients undetectable to the buyer. This includes nitrous oxide balloons widely available in nightlife establishments. You should also avoid purchasing liquor or cigarettes from street vendors or strangers, as the authenticity of the contents cannot be assured. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General for assistance. Vietnam’s local equivalent of an emergency line is 113. Local police will issue a report of a crime, but generally will only initiate investigations for crimes they determine serious, which do not always equate with U.S. standards. Investigations can take several months or even years to complete. In the event you are a victim of a crime, local police will issue a crime report in Vietnamese, but generally will only initiate investigations for crimes they determine serious. While the overall situation is improving, some police have asked for bribes, ostensibly to support local police efforts or to facilitate investigation of a crime. If you are involved in a situation where a police officer is soliciting money, contact American Citizen Services at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . We can: Help you find appropriate medical care. Assist you in reporting a crime to the police. Contact relatives or friends with your written consent. Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion. Provide a list of local attorneys. Provide information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited support in cases of destitution. Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home. Replace a stolen or lost passport. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy or Consulate General for assistance . Note that local authorities take a different attitude towards domestic violence cases and are hesitant to get involved in cases involving foreigners. Vietnam has very limited infrastructure to support victims of domestic violence. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .","Medical facilities in Vietnam, including emergency response services, frequently do not meet international standards and may lack medicine and supplies. We strongly recommend travelers purchase medical evacuation insurance before visiting Vietnam. Medical personnel generally speak little or no English. Doctors and hospitals expect immediate cash payment for health services. You may obtain lists of local English-speaking physicians from the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi or the U.S. Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City from our website . International health clinics in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City can treat minor illnesses and injuries, but more serious problems often require medical evacuation to other cities in the region. Although you can purchase many prescription and non-prescription medications at pharmacies, some common U.S. medications may not be available. You should bring adequate supplies of medications for the duration of your stay in Vietnam and ensure with the Ministry of Health that the medicine you need is allowed to enter Vietnam. You should carry a copy of your prescription if carrying medicine in a travel case or container. We strongly recommend travelers purchase medical evacuation insurance before visiting Vietnam. Travelers to Vietnam are at risk of the following diseases: Tuberculosis, Dengue Fever, Zika, Avian Influenza (H5N1), and HIV. You can find detailed information on vaccinations and other health precautions on the CDC website . We do not pay medical bills. The U.S. government cannot pay medical bills and does not provide medical assistance. Also, be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept upfront payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. If covered by TriCare, check the TriCare website ( https://www.tricare.mil/ ) for additional information about overseas coverage. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation as it can cost many thousands of dollars. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. It is extremely important that travelers have sufficient funds and/or insurance to cover any potential medical costs.  Frequently hospitals will hold onto a patient’s passport as collateral for payment, and patients may have difficulty getting their passport back without paying their medical bills in full.  Patients who do not pay their medical bills in full also run the risk of being barred from departing the country. Vaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Air quality: Air pollution is a significant problem in Vietnam’s major cities, and you should consult your doctor prior to travel and consider the impact that seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. To obtain information on the air quality in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, please follow the link to the Environmental Protection Agency’s AirNow website . Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City’s Air Quality Index (AQI) can be observed either by clicking on the Vietnam location on the map, or by selecting Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City in the “Select a City” option on the upper right part of the page. The page provides AQI over the last 24-hour period as well as pollutant concentration and a downloadable historical document.","Criminal Penalties: You are subject to Vietnamese laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Vietnam are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines, or even the death penalty. Police periodically raid nightlife establishments suspected of engaging in the drug trade and during these raids will subject all patrons present to drug testing at the police station. A positive result, regardless of whether drugs were consumed in Vietnam or before entry, may result in criminal charges. In Vietnam, you may be taken in for questioning if you do not have proper ID, such as a passport or a copy of your visa. Driving under the influence of alcohol resulting in a fatal accident could lead to immediate imprisonment. If you break local laws in Vietnam, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. Note that the Vietnamese legal system allows for lengthy criminal investigation periods that can lead to prolonged pre-trial detention; some investigations can last years without any explanation. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. You can be prosecuted in the United States for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under the host country’s laws. Arrest Notification in Vietnam: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General immediately. There are often delays in notification by the Vietnamese authorities to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General and officials have been known to delay consular access to prisoners for several weeks. Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or forfeit them upon return to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information. Gambling: Gambling is highly regulated by the government and persons or businesses running games or gambling halls are required to be licensed. The Government of Vietnam pursues cases of running or playing in unlicensed games aggressively. There are currently U.S. citizens serving jail sentences of three to five years because of illegal gambling. Dual Nationality: Dual nationality is accepted by the Vietnamese government in some, but not all, circumstances. However, dual nationals should be aware that Vietnam recognizes their Vietnamese citizenship as primary before others. In such cases, the U.S. Embassy and Consulate General may be limited in the consular services we are able to provide. U.S. citizens who also hold Vietnamese citizenship and are currently residing in Vietnam may wish to contact local authorities and/or seek competent legal advice on how local laws may affect their status. For detailed information on Vietnamese nationality law and other legal issues visit the Embassy of Vietnam website . Work Authorization: The Government of Vietnam maintains strict laws with respect to foreign workers. U.S. citizens planning to work in Vietnam should make sure that they are in full compliance with Vietnamese regulations. Penalties can be severe and include deportation, fines, or detention. Vietnam immigration law allows for companies sponsoring foreign employees to exercise control over their employees’ visas, including prohibiting their exit from the country if they have any outstanding debts. Teaching English: We advise those considering accepting an English teaching job in Vietnam to carefully review the terms of the contract regarding working and living conditions and to ask for multiple references from persons familiar with the institution, especially former U.S. citizen employees, before committing to contracts. Some U.S. citizens have reported their employers have reneged on contract terms, including offering significantly lower salaries than agreed or seizing their passports, and employers have caused complications with the exit visa process for employees who quit, complicating the exit visas required to depart the country. Hotels: Hotels in Vietnam require you to present your passport (and visas, if issued separately) upon check-in so that your stay can be registered with local police. Every guest in a hotel room or private residence must be registered, regardless of nationality. If you stay at a private residence (i.e., at the residence of family or friends), you must comply with registration requirements by visiting the local police station and registering your stay within 24 hours. Some provinces allow registration online. Exports: Vietnamese law prohibits the export of antiques. However, these laws are vague and unevenly enforced. Customs authorities may inspect and seize your antiques without compensating you, and the determination of what is an “antique” can be arbitrary. If you purchase non-antique items of value, you should retain receipts and confirmation from shop owners and/or the Ministry of Culture and the Customs Department to prevent seizure when you leave the country. Imports: Vietnamese authorities have seized documents, audio and video tapes, compact discs, literature, and personal letters they deem to be pornographic or political in nature or intended for religious or political proselytizing. It is illegal to import weapons, ammunition, explosives, military equipment and tools (including uniforms), narcotics, drugs, toxic chemicals, pornographic and subversive materials, firecrackers, or children's toys that have ""negative effects on personality development, social order, and security."" For up-to-date information on Vietnam Customs information, please visit the Vietnam Customs website . Freedom of Expression: The Government of Vietnam maintains strict control over all forms of political speech, particularly dissent or speech it deems as critical of the government and/or party. U.S. citizens have been detained, tried, and convicted for political activities (including criticizing the government or its domestic/foreign policies or advocating alternatives to Communist Party rule), possession of political material, and non-sanctioned religious activities (including proselytizing). Authorities have also detained U.S. citizens for posting messages on blogs or online chatrooms that are perceived to be political or critical of the government. U.S. citizens of Vietnamese descent should be especially careful with their online postings. Review the latest version of the Vietnam Human Rights Report for the latest information on Freedom of Expression in Vietnam. Association with Groups: Persons whom the Government of Vietnam perceives to be associated with dissident or political groups may be denied entry to Vietnam, prevented from departing, detained, interrogated, placed under surveillance, or even tried and convicted. Note that if arrested, you could be subject to lengthy detention without access to an attorney or family members. U.S. citizens of Vietnamese descent should be especially careful about associating with dissident groups. U.S. citizen travelers have been summoned by immigration or local security officials for reasons that are unclear or not explicitly related to any suspected or alleged violation of law. We recommend that U.S. citizens finding themselves in this situation contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General immediately for further information and/or assistance. Photography: Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in questioning by authorities, fines, or delayed travel. You should be cautious when traveling near military bases and avoid photography in these areas. Disputes: The Vietnamese government has occasionally seized the passports and blocked the departure of foreigners involved in commercial disputes. U.S. citizens whose passports have been seized by Vietnamese authorities should contact the Embassy or Consulate General for assistance . Civil Procedures: Civil procedures in Vietnam, such as marriage, divorce, documenting the birth of a child, and issuance of death certificates, are highly bureaucratic and can be slow. Local authorities may refuse a request to include a non-Vietnamese name on a birth certificate. In addition, for those wishing to get married in Vietnam, you will need a notarized affidavit of single status. Please contact the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington, D.C. , or the Vietnamese Consulate General in San Francisco or Houston concerning documentary requirements for these services. Enforcement of civil orders is frequently difficult or non-existent. Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers . LGBTQI+ Rights: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or in attending LGBTIQ+ events in Vietnam. See our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details. Accessibility: Most public places and public transportation are not accessible to persons with disabilities. Sidewalks, curb ramps, restrooms, road crossings, and tourist areas are not equipped to assist such individuals. New, modern buildings and facilities in larger urban cities are regularly built with ramps and accessible entryways. Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips ."
Yemen,"Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Since the beginning of the current conflict in September 2014, the Houthis, who control Sana’a, have detained U.S. citizens, including dual Yemeni-American citizens.  Reports indicate that U.S. citizens are targeted by virtue of their citizenship, regardless of the amount of time they have spent in Yemen, their established connections with rebel groups, or their connections with local businesses or humanitarian organizations aimed at providing relief to those in need.  During their detentions, which in some cases have lasted years, U.S. citizens have not been allowed contact with their families or visits by U.S. consular personnel or international humanitarian organizations.  The U.S. government is severely limited in what assistance it can directly provide to U.S. citizens in detention.  There has been no U.S. government diplomatic presence in Yemen since the Houthi takeover of Sana’a. In addition to the threat of detention by rebel groups, both the ongoing conflict and heightened terrorist activity, including kidnappings for ransom, present a threat to U.S. citizens in Yemen. In March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition initiated an air campaign in support of the exiled Yemeni government.  Violence, armed conflict, and artillery shelling persist in areas throughout the country.  While truce agreements may reduce overall levels of violence, instability and ongoing threats in Yemen remain at a severe level. Vessels in the region of the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Aden, should operate under a heightened state of alert as increasing tensions in the region escalate the potential for direct or collateral damage to vessels transiting the area. These threats may come from a variety of different sources such as missiles, projectiles, or waterborne improvised explosive devices. Piracy in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Indian Ocean remains a security threat to maritime activities in the region. In recent years, there have been hundreds of documented pirate attacks in Yemeni territorial waters in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) has also advised that elevated regional tensions have increased the risk of maritime attacks being conducted by extremists to vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and the Bab al-Mandeb regions. MARAD recommends vessels at anchor, operating in restricted maneuvering environments, or at slow speeds should be especially vigilant and report suspicious activity. U.S. flag vessels that observe suspicious activity in the area are advised to report such suspicious activity or any hostile or potentially hostile action to COMUSNAVCENT battlewatch captain at phone number 011-973-1785-3879. All suspicious activities and events are also to be reported to the U.S. Coast Guard National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802, 202-267-2675, or TDD 202-267-4477. For further information, see the Department of State’s International Maritime Piracy Fact Sheet and the United States Maritime Administration ( MARAD ) advisory on vessels transiting high risk waters. Other potential hazards to overland travelers include landmines and unexploded ordnance. This is of particular concern in the six southern provinces and in the northern highlands. Please note that the local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Yemen is 199, but operators do not speak English. Crime : Due to the ongoing civil unrest and weak government institutions, travelers should not rely on significant assistance from local authorities.  Foreigners are frequently the target of kidnapping and carjacking, particularly when traveling outside of urban areas. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime : The U.S. government is extremely limited to the consular assistance it can provide in Yemen.  Report crimes to the local police at 199.  As there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen at this time, you should coordinate with a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country for services. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . Domestic Violence: The law in Yemen protects against domestic violence under general prohibitions of violence, but authorities do not enforce this provision effectively. The law criminalizes rape, but not spousal rape. Authorities may prosecute rape survivors on charges of fornication if the perpetrator is not charged with rape. According to law, without the perpetrator’s confession, the rape survivor must provide four male witnesses to the crime. The law allows leniency for persons found guilty of committing an “honor” killing or violently assaulting or killing a woman for perceived “immodest” or “defiant” behavior. The law does not address other types of gender-based abuse, such as forced isolation, imprisonment, and early and forced marriage. See section 6 of our Human Rights Report for additional information. As there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen at this time, U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should coordinate with a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country.  The U.S. government is extremely limited to the consular assistance it can provide in Yemen. Tourism :  No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place in Yemen on any level. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk.  Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .","The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the high security threat level in Yemen due to terrorist activities, kidnappings, civil unrest, and landmines.  The Department urges U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Yemen and urges U.S. citizens currently living in Yemen to depart. All visitors to Yemen are required to obtain a visa prior to travel to Yemen.  U.S. citizens typically are issued visas that are valid for 30 days.  At the time of publication, the Embassy of Yemen in Washington, D.C. is not issuing tourist visas.

In Yemen, the law may be applied inconsistently, and foreign travelers may be taken in for questioning if they do not have their passport with them.  Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs can land the driver immediately in jail.  The criminal penalties in Yemen may be very different from what U.S. citizens are accustomed to in the United States. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website. Arrest Notification : The U.S. government is extremely limited to the consular assistance it can provide in Yemen.  The U.S. Department of State has designated the U.S. Embassies in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, Djibouti, and Cairo, Egypt, to handle American Citizens Services cases emanating out of Yemen.  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy in one of these locations immediately.  See our webpage and notice to all U.S. citizens in Yemen for further information. Special Circumstances : Photographing military installations, including airports, equipment, or troops is forbidden.  Such photography has led to the arrest of U.S. citizens.  Military sites are not always obvious.  If in doubt, ask specific permission from Yemeni authorities. U.S. citizens who travel to Yemen are subject to the jurisdiction of Yemeni courts, as well as to the country's laws, customs, and regulations. This holds true for all legal matters, including child custody and travel restrictions. The US Embassy cannot intervene in custody matters, and parents must work through the local courts.  Women in custody disputes in Yemen will not enjoy the same rights that they do in the United States, as Yemeni law often does not work in favor of the mother.  U.S. custody orders might not be enforced in Yemen. U.S. citizen girls and women who travel to Yemen are at risk of being forced into marriage and may be vulnerable to other forms of gender-based restrictions and violence, particularly in Houthi-controlled areas.  U.S. citizen women who are married to Yemeni or Yemeni-American men should be aware that their children may not be able to depart if the children are brought to Yemen.  In many instances, women must obtain permission from their husbands to obtain an exit visa.  They also may not be able to take their children out of Yemen without the permission of the father, regardless of who has legal custody.  U.S. divorce decrees may not be recognized in Yemen, especially if the marriage took place in Yemen.  In some cases, U.S. citizen women who have married in Yemen and divorced in the United States have been prevented from departing Yemen by their ex-husbands. Faith-Based Travelers: The law prohibits denunciation of Islam, conversion from Islam to another religion, and proselytizing directed at Muslims. Religious minorities face persecution, including detention, as a result of their religious beliefs, particularly in Houthi-controlled areas.

Students: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips . Women Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers . Women face deeply entrenched discrimination. Women cannot marry without the permission of their male guardians; do not have equal rights in inheritance, divorce, or child custody; and have little legal protection. They experience discrimination in employment, credit, pay, owning or managing businesses, education, and housing.  A male relative’s consent is often required before a woman can be admitted to a hospital. Women traveling in areas under Houthi control may be required to be escorted by a male guardian who is a relative. See Section 6 of our Human Rights Report and the Special Circumstances section above for more information."
